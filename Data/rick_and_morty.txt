Morty, you got to... come on.

You got to come with me.

Rick, what's going on?

I got a surprise for you, Morty.

It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?

I got a surprise for you.

Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard.

I got a surprise for you, Morty.

What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty?

I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.

Yeah, Rick, it's great.

Is this the surprise?

Morty, I had to...

I had to... I had to... I had to make a bomb, Morty.

I had to create a bomb.

What?! A bomb?!

We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty.

Create a whole fresh start.

T-t-that's absolutely crazy!

Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty.

It's gonna be good.

Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.

Jessica? From my math class?

When I drop the bomb... you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.

And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty.

No, you can't!

Jessica doesn't even know I exist.

But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity.

I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty.

Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me... trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything.

I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.

What are you talking about, Rick?

You you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything.

She she she she... she's all for you, Morty.

I don't care about Jessica!

You know what, Morty?

You're right.

Let's forget the girl all together.

She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.

Arming neutrino bomb.

That's it that's it, Rick.

I'm taking the wheel.

Get off of me, Morty!

I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy.

What's gotten into you?

I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb...

What are you, crazy?

...person and just let you blow up the whole world.

All right, all right.

I'll I'll land.

I'll land. I'll land.

I'll land the thing.

Big tough guy all of a sudden.

We'll park it right here, Morty.

Right here on the side of the road here.

Oh, thank God.

You know what?

That was all a test, Morty.

Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.

It was?

Sure. Why not?

I don't know.

You you know what, mo-

Neutrino bomb armed.

Um... I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight.

Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?

Oh, my God. His head is in his food.

I'm going to puke.

Morty, are you getting sick?

I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow.

The dog sleeps on it.

I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.

I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.

Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.

What?!

Dad?

What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now?

You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?

Damn it!

Jerry!

Beth!

Oh, my God.

My parents are so loud. I want to die.

Mm, there is no God, summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now.

You'll thank me later.

Okay, with all due respect, Rick... What am I talking about?

What respect is due?

How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?

Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything.

It's your house. It's your world.

You're a real Julius Caesar.

But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry.

It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.

G-guy up front says, "two plus two."

The people in the back say, "four."

Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something.

I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.

And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.

This was a good breakfast, Beth.

You really made the crap out of those eggs.

I wish your mother was here to eat them.

Oh, dad.

What? For real?

All right, now, everybody get settled.

Get away from the windows!

Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today.

You might have heard of it. It's called math.

And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in.

Two plus two.

Jessica.

Five plus five.

Tenssica.

Okay, good. It's time for the quiz.

Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad!

Tough!

First row, take one. Pass it back for me.

The stakes are high in this room.

There's crucial things happening here every day.

People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber.

Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00.

Hi, Morty.

Whoa! Hi, Jessica.

Can I show these to you?

Wow.

Th-they're both great. Thank you.

You know what I named these? My little morties.

Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.

Do you know what I want you to do with them?

Rename them?

Squeeze them.

Manhandle them. Give them the business.

See if you can shuffle them.

I mean, really get in there and knock them around.

No wrong answers.

Wow.

Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shit.

Mm.

Oh, Morty.

What are you doing to me?

Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.

Morty! What are you doing to me?!

Jessica.

Morty!

Jessica.

Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.

Je-Jessica.

Jessica.

Not my fault this is happening.

Well, well, well.

Uh, morning, Frank.

"Morning"?

What was what is that supposed to mean?

You making fun of me?

Are you trying to say my family's poor?

Oh, geez, Frank.

I don't know if a knife is necessary.

I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.

You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty.

And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich.

There you are, Morty. Listen to me.

I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension.

I need an extra pair of hands.

Oh, geez, Rick. What'd you do to Frank?

It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him.

Now listen I need your help, Morty.

I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.

It's important. Come on, Morty.

I don't know, Rick.

I can't leave school again.

Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

What do you think I can just do it all by myself?

Come on!

Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history.

What about Frank?

I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?

I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine.

Let's go.

Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky.

This is the story we'll be telling our children.

Hi, Frank.

Aah!

Scalpel.

Scalpel.

Knock, knock.

Jerry?

My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"

We're losing him. Okay, he's back.

Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.

Well, it's lunch.

I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.

Losing him.

Stabilized.

Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.

Well, yeah, on horses.

Excuse me?

Okay. Let's not rehash that fight.

I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.

Whoa!

What is this on the floor?

Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home.

Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here.

Let's put your dad in a nursing home.

We're losing him.

Hey, Tom. We know when we're losing him.

We can hear the beeps!

There she is.

All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.

Oh, geez. Okay.

Oh, man, Rick.

What is this place?

It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.

I'm talking about mega seeds.

They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.

Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.

All right. All right. Calm down. Listen to me, Morty.

I know that new situations can be intimidating.

You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people.

I'm no stranger to scary situations.

I deal with them all the time.

Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run!

I never seen that thing before in my life.

I don't even know what the hell it is!

We got to get out of here, Morty!

It's gonna kill us!

We're gonna die!

We're gonna die, Morty!

Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty.

Y-you smell that?

That's the smell of adventure, Morty.

That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.

All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be?

Shouldn't I be back at school by now?

Are you joking me?

I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.

Look at that thing right there. What the hell is that thing?

You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?

Look at it just lumbering around.

It defies all logic that thing.

Yeah, Rick, I get it.

We're surrounded by monsters.

That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.

Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

Morty, you see this?

You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty?

Any idea what that is down there?

The mega trees?

That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them.

And that's what I'm talking about, Morty.

That's where my seeds are.

If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.

All right, all right.

So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?

You ask a lot of questions, Morty.

Not very charismatic.

It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure.

Just take these shoes, Morty.

They're special grappling shoes.

When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left.

These things really bring it all together.

Aah!

You have to turn them on, Morty!

The shoes have to be turned on!

I am not putting my father in a home!

He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret?

I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day.

More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.

Everything cool in here, Beth?

It's fine, Davin.

Okay, cool.

You know, we did something great today.

There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.

Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.

Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but...

Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having... is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.

Well, maybe you're right.

Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart.

Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?

Horse heart surgeon.
Hello?

Mrs. Smith?

This is principal vagina, no relation.

I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?

Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.

You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work.

Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here.

It was a leisurely breeze.

I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

Yeah, I can see that.

But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?

Are you kidding me?!

That's it, Rick!

That's the last straw!

I can't believe this!

I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?!

Ooh! Ow! Oh!

Y-y-you're a monster.

Y-you're like hitler, but but even hitler cared about Germany or something.

Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.

Ooh.

Ohh.

Ooh.

Wow, Rick.

That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.

I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.

Thank you.

Don't worry about it, Morty.

Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?

Sure thing, Rick.

Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is...

I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine... that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.

The stuff was all over the place, Morty.

Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up.

The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever.

I was the only old person there, Morty.

It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.

I-I was fascinating to them.

There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me.

I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty.

It's got no charge left.

What?!

It's as good as garbage, Morty.

It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

W-what are we gonna do?

I-I have to be back at school right now.

How are we gonna get back home?

There's ways to get back home, Morty.

It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.

Uh-oh.

When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.

In my butt?

Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.

Oh, geez, Rick.

I really don't want to have to do that.

Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.

Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty.

And they'll fall right out of mine.

I've done this too many times, Morty.

I mean, you're young.

You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable.

You got to do it for grandpa, Morty.

Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.

In my butt?

Come on, Morty.

Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.

Oh, man.

The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.

What? Why didn't you notify us?

I done been notifying you.

Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather?

Boom!

Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child!

Wait, what am I celebrating?

Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.

Summer?

What kind of God lets this happen?

We had a little incident.

A student was frozen to death.

And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it!

Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.

I won't let them.

The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.

So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know?

This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency.

It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk.

The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.

I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy.

I don't like being told where to go and what to do.

I consider it a violation.

Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?

Yeah, Rick.

Let's just get this over with, okay?

I mean, these things are pointy.

They hurt.

That means they're good ones.

You're a good kid, Morty.

Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.

You've been a huge help to me.

I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.

It's gonna be great, Morty.

All kinds of science.

Okay, next through.

Except you. You go over there.

Why does he have to go over there?

Random check.

He's got to go through the new machine.

What new machine?

It's a new machine.

It detects stuff all the way up your butt.

Run, Morty! Run!

Aah!

Red alert!

Ohhhhh!

Hey! Ohhhhhh.

Aah!

Don't think about it!

Ooh!

Oh, nice, Morty!

The student becomes the teacher.

Whoooooo!

Aah!

Aw, hell, no, dawg.

You know me I'm just trying to-

Aah!

I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty.

Cover me.

Oh, man.

I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.

They're just robots, Morty!

It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!

Aah!

My leg is shot off!

Glenn's bleeding to death!

Someone call his wife and children!

They're not robots, Rick!

It's a figure of speech, Morty.

They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them.

Just keep shooting, Morty.

You have no idea what prison is like here!

Holy crap! This is insane!

Come on, Morty!

We got to get the hell out of here!

Wow.

Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?

Uh, yeah.

Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop.

Just kidding.

You're Morty, right?

Yeah.

You can get his number later. Come on, Morty.

We got to get out of here.

You got to get those seeds out of your ass.

Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.

What?

I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.

Oh, hi, Jerry.

Oh, my goodness, Morty!

What are you doing out of class?

We talked about this.

Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior.

No? No takers?

You guys should really not be touching that stuff.

It's beyond your reasoning.

You're beyond our reasoning!

Takes one to know one.

Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school?

I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl.

He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

What what are you guys doing with my stuff?

We're moving you... to a nursing home.

A nursing home?

What are what are you, nuts?

I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.

Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS... and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas.

What does that mean?

It's personal.

Dad, mom, come on.

Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty, stay out of this.

You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.

What are you trying to say about Morty?

That he's stupid or something?

Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.

I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.

Can can can you be a little bit more specific?

Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something.

Is that what you want us to say?

I do?

Well, duh doy, son.

Look, I love you, Morty, but... we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.

Aw, geez, dad.

Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.

Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.

Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.

The square root of pi, Morty. Go!

1.77245385.

Whoa!

What the hell?

Holy crap. He's right.

Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.

"The increment in the internal energy of a system is... equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."

Wow! I'm so smart!

But I told the both of you school is stupid.

It's not how you learn things.

Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind.

That's why he's my little helper.

He's like me.

He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.

He's too smart for school.

He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.

Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.

No, I-I understand.

Uh, maybe we overreacted.

But he has to keep going to school.

Okay, Jerry.

You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do?

Say no?

You you really wear the pants around here.

I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication.

Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!

No idea what you're talking about.

Okay.

Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.

Don't stay up all night again.

This is good, though. This can work.

I think we can be a family.

And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.

You know what? Okay.

Holy cow, Rick.

I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.

Full disclosure, Morty it's not.

Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.

Aw, man.

Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.

Starting right about now.

Ohh, man. Oh, geez! Ohh.

I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer.

In reality, you're as dumb as they come.

And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more.

And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty.

And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty.

But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty.

Just you and me, Morty.

The outside world is our enemy, Morty.

We're the only friends we've got, Morty.

It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty.

Rick and Morty forever and forever.

100 years, Rick and Morty's things.

Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time.

All day long, forever.

All a hundred days.

Rick and Morty forever 100 times.

Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby.

...beautiful putt right there good birdie.

That's only the... eighth birdie of the day.

What? Why are you looking at me?

You want to go outside? Outside?

Outside?

Are you kidding me?!

Come on!

Oh, my God.

What's wrong?

Your idiot dog!

Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles?

You're a good boy.

Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet!

Bad dog! Bad!

Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.

Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.

You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?

I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.

Come on, Morty.

Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family.

You make that dog smart or... Morty's grounded!

Ha-ha!

Aw, man!

Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.

All right, ruffles... What's his name?

Snuffles.

Snuffles, shake.

Roll over.

Go to the bathroom.

Holy crap!

No way.

Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry.

Have fun. Come on, Morty.

That was fantastic, Rick!

Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.

W-w-w-what is it?

It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty.

It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.

You talking about "Inception"?

That's right, Morty.

This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense.

"Inception" made sense.

You don't have to try to impress me, Morty.

Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty.

That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.

Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?

Are you listening to me, Morty?

Homework is stupid.

The whole point is to get less of it.

Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing.

W-we're gonna incept your teacher.

You're frustrating me.

You don't know me!

Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.

Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...

You don't know me!

Then let me get to know yo, damn it!

Uh-oh! Spoilers!

I'm a full season behind.

Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house.

It's really weird.

It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.

Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

I'll take two.

Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.

You don't know me.

All right, Morty, time to make our move.

Make it bounce.

No, you didn't.

Oh, jiggle it now.

You better stop with that.

Allahu akbar!

We're gonna take control of this plane!

We're gonna 9/!! it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!

Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

The name's not buddy.

It's Goldenfold.

Nice to wheat you!

Take cover, Morty!

Ooh!

Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated.

I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.

I didn't take him for an active dreamer.

We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty.

But we can't get killed.

If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.

What?! Are you kidding me?!

Ohhhhhh!

Don't be a baby!

You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty.

Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!

Now bring me my slippers.

Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

This is what I'm talking about.

This is a dog.

Oh, yeah.

This should play out just fine.

You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what.

Oh, my God.

He's trying to tell us something.

That is so awesome.

Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".

He's saying "I love Obama".

So cute!

I'm posting this online, like, right now.

I should call Bob Saget.

Is that still a thing?

Hmm?

Goldenfold, we're coming out!

We just want to talk!

Why would I negotiate with you?

Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.

And because I have a human shield.

Mrs. Pancakes!

Oh, no, Morty.

His subconscious is panicking.

Run!

Relax, Morty.

Look!

Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

Come on!

Hey, you don't know me!

Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!

Pretty concise, Morty.

Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.

That's it, Morty!

Prolonging the inevitable!

Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.

That'll buy us some time to figure this out!

You don't know m-

All right, let's go.

Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

Don't judge, Morty.

Okay. All right, well...

Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there.

I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.

Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea.

Listen to me.

If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

I'll talk to you after lunch.

Ooh, hey!

Ooh, oh!

Oh, man.

Come and join us.

I'm sorry. No, no.

Ooh, come here!

No, thanks!

Ooh, wow!

Come over here, baby!

No, I'm okay.

Whoa!

Summer?!

Hey, there, stranger.

What do you think of these things?

Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What's the matter with you, Morty?

Calm down!

You're kind of killing the vibe in here.

It's Summer!

Aw, geez.

Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.

Can you blame him?

Come on, old man, little boy.

Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake!

This is disgusting!

I'm gonna puke!

I can't take it, Rick!

Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death!

Off with their heads!

Time to go another dream deep, Morty!

What the hell?

Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?

Geez, I don't know, Morty.

Wha-what do you want from me?

Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!

Oh, here we go!

Holy crap!

Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.

I'm scary Terry.

You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

Whoa! Hey, buddy.

What you got going on there?

Snuffles fix.

Make better.

Humans understand snuffles now?

That... is... awesome!

Snuffles want to be understood.

Snuffles need to be understood.

Okay, yeah.

I get what Beth was talking about.

Fun's over.

Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.

Why not?

I don't know.

It's Indian giving.

A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill.

It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.

Aw! Oh, my God!

He recognizes the other dogs on TV.

"A," "b" his name is scary Terry "C," "d" he's very scary

Holy crap!

We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!

Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

"E," "f" he'll design your death The little girl!

Huh?

"J," "k," he'll really ruin your day Are you kidding me? This again?

Oh, man, it looks like we've hot dream bedrock here, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick.

W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!

Ohhhh!

Holy crap, Morty.

He can travel through dreams.

He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!

Where are my testicles, Summer?

Where are my testicles, Summer?

They were removed. Where have they gone?
Oh, wow.

That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles.

Do not call me that!

"Snuffles" was my slave name.

You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.

Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay?

You're scaring me.

Scaring you?

Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?

Uhhh...

Hey.

Oh, wow.

Okay, is is is everything okay in here?

Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?

No!

No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...

Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!

Yeah. Totally.

Let's go.

You will walk when it is time to walk.

What are we here for again?

Incepting?

We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?

Oh, yeah.

Buckle up, bitch!

Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!

You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

Hold on, Morty.

Y-you know what?

He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.

I say we try hiding.

But that's the opposite of what-

Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?

Hey, you know what?

You got a really good point there, Rick.

Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know?

I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.

Worst-case scenario we're back to running.

Wow, you know what?

I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time.

Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.

Thanks, Morty.

Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.

You can run...

But you can't hide!

Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that.

He's getting sleepy.

Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.

That's when we make our move.

Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm!

This is a huge misunderstanding.

Dad, he wants to be called snowball.

Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.

You're being very aggressive, Jerry.

Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.

You think you can control me with a haircut?

Hi, honey. You're home early.

How was your day?

I don't want to talk about it!

Oh, of course.

You never want to talk about it.

Get off my back, bitch!

Out there. Not in here.

Yeah, I know, I know.

I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon.

I love you, Melissa.

I love you, too, Terry.

Morty, this is perfect.

After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.

Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.

Oh, boy, Rick.

I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know... scare scary Terry.

Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch!

Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!

Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?

Oh... um...

"bitch."

Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

Hey, leave him alone!

Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.

Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone?

Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?

Well, I never!

I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.

You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry.

You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.

Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants... dawg.

Here's a pair on us, fool.

Aww, bitch.

I don't know what to say.

You don't need to say anything.

We got you, dawg.

You're our boy, dawg.

Don't even trip.

Oh, hey, it's you guys!

I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.

If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.

As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.

"Q," "r," you won't get very far I always hated that song!

These halves don't belong together, bitch!

Sex is sacred!

This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

Holy crap! God damn!

I know one thing for sure...

I'm giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea.

That is an original thought.

What the hell?

Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

Oh, man, what's going on?

Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.

I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.

This is why I choose to get C's.

Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

Dad!

Rick!

Oh, thank God, Morty.

Oh, you're welcome.

All right, let's get out of here.

If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We're not going anywhere.

This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.

It's all over, Jerry.

The dogs are on a path to total world domination.

But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?

Wait a minute. I have an idea.

Gentlemen, a moment of your time.

See that?

I'm peeing all over your special gun.

That means I own them.

Bad person. Bad.

Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

Bring the boy to me.

You were always kind to me, Morty.

That's why I will leave you with your testicles.

From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.

Th-thanks, snuffles.

Begin phase two.

Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard.

It appears clear at this time... that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end.

Please! Please don't kill me!

What's she saying, bill?

I think she's saying, "I love lasagna."

Mmm.

Thank you, Fido.

Rick!

I thought you were dead!

No, no, no, I was just playing dead.

Good news, though, Morty.

This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.

What?

It's a dream, Morty.

We're in your dog's dream.

The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep.

Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

But I-it's been like a whole year!

It's been six hours.

Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time.

So, you know, every day here is like a minute.

It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.

Aw, man. I really liked this life.

Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.

No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.

You're sleeping in your crap right now.

Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants.

I mean, it's a mess out there.

I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.

Aw, man, geez! Seriously?

Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.

Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.

Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?

Close.

It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

What?!

It's necessary for the plan, Morty.

Don't even trip, dawg.

It's pretty bad, emperor snowball.

We're gonna need to do another operation.

Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.

Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy.

You could lose your kingdom.

To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.

I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.

Do you think they would have done this for us?

We are not them!

We are not... them.

Assemble the troops.

I've made a decision.

Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty.

Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.

I'm gonna miss you, snowball.

You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.

Jerry?

I'm sorry.

It's just like the end of "Old Yeller."

Oh, Jerry.

You mean because it had dogs in it.

Wow!

A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.

I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.

I think it will be great, Morty.

You know... it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages.

I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.

You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.

You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.

What do you know, Morty?

What do you know?

Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class.

My name is scary Mr. Johnson.

Uh, actually, you know what?

That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah?

So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear.

Which is what is that?

You know?

So, uh, here here's what I say... you can't learn anything until you learn... how to chill.

Oooh!

This is how you dream, bitch.

Mmm.

Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.

Um, merry Christmas. Hello?

My parents are coming over for the first time in years.

Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?

Alive? For your parents?

Mm, good one.

Hey, man!

You "hey, man!" This holiday is about humanity.

You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.

Whatever.

All electronic items are going in the stocking now.

Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.

Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook.

A-ho, ho, ho, everybody.

More like "whoa, whoa, whoa."

What is this? My parents are coming!

Calm down, Jerry.

This is Reuben, an old friend.

Pearl harbor.

I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation.

Aww!

Dad, that is so sweet!

Yeah, it is.

I don't get it.

Korea.

Don't worry about your Christmas, Jerry.

I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.

Huh. You think you know a guy.

Okay, there's my parents.

Now, remember no TV, no phones, no laptops.

We are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday.

Hey, hey!

Merry Christmas, son.

Uh, hi. Can I help you?

Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message?

No!

You must be Jerry. That's a fine-looking apron.

Williams-sonoma?

I wish!

But thank you.

So, you're a... friend of the family?

Uh, the way we see it, he's a part of the family.

Wow.

After your father's brush with cancer and losing your Uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it?

What are we going to be when we die... a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences?

Holy crap. Joyce, that's amazing.

Then Jacob came into our lives, and... we're learning to live again.

All three of us.

Cool.

Eggnog?

Now we are talking!

This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?

Hi, Joyce. Leonard.

Hello, there.

Merry Christmas, man.

Morty, a moment of your time?

He's in bad shape, Morty.

Aw, geez, Rick. What'd you do?

Gee, thanks, Morty.

What kind of monster do you think I am?

I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life.

I need your help.

I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom.

He'll know what's going on.

Uh, where where do I find Dr. Bloom?

In Reuben.

Reuben, Minnesota?

Reuben on the table, Morty.

Look, I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything.

Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.

What proc-

Hey, dad, where's Morty?

He's busy.

Morty, can you hear me? Head north.

Rick, where am I?

Depending on my aim, you should be just South of the entrance.

Entrance to what?

Welcome, Morty.

Welcome... to anatomy park!

It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body.

Science isn't cheap, Morty.

This should really help put a dent in the overhead.

Oh, my God! This is insane!

Spleen Mountain? Bladder falls?

Pirates of the pancreas?

You got a problem with that last one, Morty?

Huh? No, no.

I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em.

Okay. All right.

If I sounded a little defensive, it's because... pirates of the pancreas was my baby.

You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty.

I guess I'm still a little defensive.

Let's just find Dr. Bloom, all right?

I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.

Proceed to the liver.

Arriving at... liver.

Ow!

Mind the gap.

It's really scary in here, Rick.

The liver's under maintenance.

Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty.

Don't judge.

You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.

Rick! It's a monster!

No, no, no. Morty.

The only monster here is alco...... holism.

That is an animatronic werewolf.

Who are you?! Answer me!

Where'd you come from?

My my my grandpa Rick sent me!

Poncho!

That's quite enough.

Morty, that's Poncho.

This is Roger and Annie.

And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

Hey, Bloom, it's Rick.

What the hell's going on here?

I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down, and I'm afraid... the exhibits are unlocked.

Exhibits?

Anatomy park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the...

Pirates of the pancreas.

Watch it.

It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.

Diseases?

Hey, doc.

I got news for you.

Your living museum is officially a wild safari!

Hepatitis A! Run!

Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl.

Oh, Jacob.

I'm sorry, Jacob.

I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents.

Are you, like, uh are you, like, their caretaker?

Is that what it is?

We can go into detail later, son.

Now, wait.

Th-there's no point to secrecy.

Let's all live and die honestly.

Your mother and I have shared 40 years of each other, mind, body, and soul, and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment.

Dad, please.

What are you saying?

Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you.

Hey, speak for yourself, because it... sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Jacob is your mother's lover.

I watch them sometimes... from a chair and sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as superman.

Oh.

Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right?

It's incredible.

Happy human holiday, dad.

Aah!

Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system.

That's strange.

Airflow is down 20%.

So, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen.

That's why security's offline.

Well, I guess we better check it out.

Hey! Wait for me!

Put that back on!

If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for a blockage.

I'll go.

Don't be a hero, kid.

I'm not.

I'm doing it because it's fun.

We shouldn't be here.

Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here.

We must save Reuben. This is my life's work.

It's all right, my dear.

Nearly all human lungs contain... a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them...

Dormant.

Morty, get down!

Whoa-ho-ho!

Whoa!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, what are those things?

Tuberculosis coming in fast!

Not faster than a bullet!

Aah!

No!

Do you know what you've done?!

Whoa!

Get to the digestive tract!

He's coughing!

Whoaaaa!

Don't let me die!

Just take a deep breath, Reuben.

You're not gonna die!

What's your name?

My name is...

Alexand-

Rick r-r-Reuben's got tuberculosis!

Oh, great work, Morty.

Okay, I'll just cure it and then-

Okay.

Well, I can't cure death.

This is bad, Morty.

You're trapped in a dead man.

Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas.

Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty.

It's a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas.

We don't whitewash it, either, Morty.

I mean, the pirates are really rapey.

The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself.

Oh, man. What is that horrible smell?

You mean the panda express?

Kidding. I-I'm kidding.

The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas.

We're inside a corpse, my boy.

Anatomy park is doomed.

Forget about the park, doctor!

How do we get out?

The digestive tract is the evacuation route.

Get it?

There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.

Everybody, head for the colon!

Now I'm taking orders from a 12-year-old boy?

Morty, the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged.

This disaster was an inside job.

Keep your eye on Annie.

She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.

Intestines are ahead to the left, then to the right, then left, et cetera.

Hey, just so you know, I'm actually 14.

So, you know...

What?

Not 12.

Okay.

You know, because he just said I was 12.

Oh.

Good for you.

Oof. Ugh. Morty. Strike one.

It goes on like this for miles.

Then we get to the large intestine!

Shh!

I hear something.

Don't move.

Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.

Wait, I was wrong. I was thinking of a T. Rex.

Move!

We're sitting ducks!
Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas?

Yes. Why?

Kid, you're a genius.

Are you mad?!

Everybody, in here!

Hey, gonorrhea!

How's this for a burning sensation?

Huh.

Oh, I love to hear you sing.

Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.

I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for.

I'm being punished for taking your iPad.

What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay?

I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.

Summer!

Ethan?

What are you doing here?

I've been texting you for hours!

What the hell?!

I don't have my phone!

I'm doing a human holiday!

Well, did you even consider how that might make me feel?!

How you feel?!

Why is everything always happening to you?!

Summer, do you have a boyfriend?

Yeah, do you, Summer?

I don't know, Ethan. Do I?!

Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.

I should be able to access... the backup generator to get the growth ray online.

If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes.

I just hope Reuben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.

What the hell is that?

The sphincter dam.

We built it when Reuben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse load.

I've almost got it.

Everybody, move inside the circle.

Poncho? What is this in your backpack?

That's bubonic plague!

What are you doing with that, Poncho?

Everybody, get back!

Poncho, you son of a bitch!

You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?

That's right, baby.

A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population.

I'll take the highest bidder...

Al-qaeda, North Korea, Republicans, shriners, balding men that work out, people on the Internet that are only turned on... by cartoons of Japanese teenagers.

Anything is better than working for you, you pompous, negligent, iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday- bonus-giving mother-

Come on!

Aah!

Get off!

You guys!

It's gonna burst! Go!

Go, go, go!

My foot is stuck.

No!

It's okay! It's okay. Just go.

Tell my family I love them.

They may be hard to find 'cause my wife... kept her last name and she made the kids take it, too, so, I-I don't know, you can-

No!

Let me ask you a question, Ethan.

Where's the anger coming from, man?

From Summer being a total bitch!

Where's the anger coming from?

My brother... took me fishing once... in the bushes...

I can't... I can't...

He made me feel like a girl! He made me a girl!

He didn't make you anything, man.

You are who you are.

She is who she is.

Now, you go to her... brand-new.

Come here, right now.

Oh, my God.

I'm so sorry, Ethan! I love you!

I love you so much.

Um...

You did it again, cubbie.

Come here.

No! Stop! I hate this!

Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.

Well, then I hate Christmas!

Enjoy being human!

You guys are gross and lame.

My name's Reuben Ridley.

You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey...

Whoopsie.

I'll be inside all of you.

My story begins during the dot-com crash in the early '90s.

You can put your fingers wherever you want.

Morty, you want to put it on mute or something?

I'm I'm trying to concentrate.

Uh... Rick?

Not now, Jerry.

I've got much, much smaller fish to fry.

I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you.

Right now, you're my sanest relative.

Relative.

Relative size!

Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite.

Morty, can you get to the left nipple?

Are you kidding?

I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick.

No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple.

We need to get to the left nipple!

The body is decaying.

The arterial transit system is useless.

We can try the service shuttle.

It's connected to the skeletal system.

That's why we call it the bone train.

Would you like to ride the bone train, miss?

If it'll get us out of here.

How about you, Morty?

Would you like to ride the bone train?

Why are you doing this bit?

We're gonna die! Let's go!

Well... I can see you're busy.

Merry Christmas, Rick.

There's no autopilot.

One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.

Uh, well...

No, you're you're right.

It was a dick move for me to even pause like that.

This is all my fault. You go on.

What the hell is that?

E. Coli outbreak.

Hurry!

Wait, there is an autopilot.

Wait!

It's okay! Never mind!

I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway!

They're they're chewing through the doors!

We're in the areola, Rick, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation!

I'm almost there, Morty!

Reports from all over the country have been coming in about what appears to be... a giant, naked man over the continental United States.

We now go to Tom Randolph in New York.

Tom?

Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a 70-mile cherry.

Thank you, Tom.

Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles.

We've got feet here on the west coast, Bill, giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that.

Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the rocky mountains.

Wha?

Oh my God, the track!

It's Hepatitis A!

Aaaah!

The nipple hole.

It's beautiful.

Oh, no!

Holy crap!

Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!

Um... wait did we have some sort of relationship with him?

I think they're just like that?

I think they're just good guys.

Oh. Huh.

Where's Dr. Bloom?

I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.

God damn it, Morty. I ask you to do one thing!

Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.

He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time.

It has funny ways of bringing families together.

I don't know, Jacob.

Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it.

I don't know if our marriage will...

It's raining blood!

Oh, shit. Find Jerry.

Oh, God.

Jerry!

It's all right.

The TV says there's nothing to worry about.

The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded.

Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country.

Everything should be fine.

Oh, yes.

Dad, can I have my phone back?

A sure, sweetie. Here.

Everybody, take a device.

It'll help you relax.

This is nice.

Yeah.

Look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.

No, we didn't, dad.

No, we didn't.

Too bad about Dr. Bloom.

He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park.

Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work.

I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new, much safer park.

What about... Pirates of the pancreas?

I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.

Boo-yah! Hold your breath.

Hey, what the hell, Rick?!

What the hell, man! I liked her!

I really had something going there, Rick!

Yeah, so I heard.

You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.

Puffy vagina.

What's wrong with that?

That doesn't sound like a problem to me.

I don't know.

Come on, let's get some stuffing.

I'm starving.

Oh, unbelievable.

We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens.

Do you guys realize that Christ was born today?

Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today.

Are are are you people even human?

What kind of Christmas is this?

Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me?

Loud and clear, Annie.

Great.

We're also on with Alejandro, our chief imaginarian.

Hey, Rick.

Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing, Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media.

Hey, everybody.

Hi, how's it going?

Hi, Rick.

So, pirates of the pancreas.

Yeah. Talk to me.

Hey, Rick. It's Alejandro speaking.

Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here, "okay, what does a pancreas do?"

And the answer was, "does it make pirates?"

No, it makes Insulin, you know?

So, we're starting with a new-

Those guys are inside me, huh?

Like, building a park?

Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan!

They're inside you building a monument to compromise!

Those people.

This whole thing, Ethan.

Cool. And who pays me?

Rick: T-t-t-this is just Sloppy craftsmanship.

Morty: Hey, Rick.

Boy, sure is really especially Beautiful out there today, huh?

Rick: Oh, yes, Morty.

I-it's almost unbelievable, Isn't it?

Morty: Yeah, you know?

There's something about the air And just the way the sunshine Is.

Rick: Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

Sure. B-brilliant.

Very convincing.

Rick: Wha convincing?

Morty: Oh. Responsive, too.

In real time. I love it.

Morty: Uhh...okay.

Beth: [ robotic ] i'm going to work.

Morty, good morning.

Dad, good morning.

I am going to work. Goodbye.

Morty: What's with mom?

Rick: Oh, what's with mom?

So, you're saying that she's acting weird?

How sophisticated.

Careful, guys.

You're gonna burn out the cpu with this one.

Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick?

You're acting weird, too.

Rick: Whatever, Quote-unquote "Morty."

Morty: All right, well...

I'll see you after school.

Ow! Oof! Ugh!

Damn it!

I'm all right. I'm okay.

All right, who can tell me What 5 x 9 is?

Morty?

Morty: Uh, me?

What is 5 x 9?

Morty: Umm...you know, it's Uhh...at least 40.

Morty, that's exactly correct!

5 x 9 is at least 40!

Come up here.

Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

Everybody, this is the best Student.

I want you to be the teacher Today.

Teach us, Morty!

Rick: Interesting.

Morty: What do you want me to teach you?

Ooh, ooh!

How do you make concentrated Dark matter?

Oh, that's a good question.

Morty: Concentrated huh?

Concentrated dark matter, the fuel for accelerated space Travel.

Now, do you know how to make it?

Morty: Umm...

Come on, Morty.

Isn't your grandpa, like, a Scientist?

Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and Stuff.

I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot.

You know, if you tell us, i'll Be your girlfriend.

Morty: Uh, you will?

Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.

Rick: Morty, uh, come on.

There's a family emergency.

Stop right there!

If he leaves, i'm giving him an "F".

Rick: He doesn't care.

Morty: Aw, man!

Rick, I have to go back!

I think I was about to get married!

Ugh!

Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty.

Morty: What?!

Rick: Listen to me, Morty.

Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now.

You got to trust me, Morty.

Morty: Ugh!

I'm gonna get an "F" in class, Rick.

Rick: Morty, that's not class.

That wasn't your teacher.

This isn't your school.

This entire world is not the world.

We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.

Morty: Wait a minute.

W-what are you talking about?

Rick: It's all fake

Morty all of it.

Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

I couldn't say so until we got In the shower.

They won't monitor us in here.

Morty: Monitor us?! Who?!

Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty the galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists.

You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.

Morty: Aw, come on, Rick.

If everyone's just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.

Rick: I can't let you do that, Morty.

Morty: Give it to me!

Rick: No!

You give it to me!

Morty: Give it! No, Rick!

Oh, god, sir!

They're still naked!

Ugh.

Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not.

I think we should make Kevin Look, sir.

What?! No!

Why would you even say that?

Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.

If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, stu...

Something is drawing a lot of processing power.

Oh, wait. No wonder.

There's another real human in the simulator.

Jerry: Okay Jerry, big pitch meeting.

Make-or-break time.

You can do this.

How did this happen?!

Where's the abductions department?

Hey, man, abductions just follows the acquisition order.

Don't put this on Acquisitions!

We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!

Well, simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so...

Oh, I see! Oh, oh!

It was no one's fault.

Oh, okay.

I'm sorry.

Well, then, problem solved.

Oh, wait no.

There's still another human in here!

Who is he?

Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith.

So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.

Well, cap his sector at 5%

Processing, keep his settings on Auto, and we'll deal with him later.

Rick Sanchez is the target.

Jerry: Got to relax.

It's just a pitch.

Got to relax.

This is earth radio.

And now, here's...human music.

Jerry: Hmm. Human music.

I like it.

Morty: Rick!

Rick: Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong!

It's the only way we can speak freely.

Look around you, Morty.

Do you really think this world is real?

You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details.

Look that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.

Morty: I don't know, Rick.

I mean, i've seen people do that before.

Rick: Well, look at that old lady.

She's--she's walking a cat on a leash.

Morty: Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.

Rick: Look, I don't want to hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty!

She's an idiot!

All right, all right, there.

What about that, Morty?

Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

Rick: Oh, really, Morty?

Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?

Morty: No, no.

I haven't seen that.

I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick?

I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live.

You know what I mean?

Rick: You're missing the point, Morty.

Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels?

I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house?

No.

Morty: So, why are they doing this?

What do they want?

Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.

We got the president of the United States in here!

We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

Morty: Concentrated dark matter?

They were asking about that in class.

Rick: Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else.

These zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty.

They dragged you into this.

Now they're gonna pay!

Morty: What do you -- what are we gonna do?

Rick: We'll scam the scammers, Morty.

And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.

Jerry: National apple farmers of America, welcome to our ad agency.

I'm Jerry Smith.

All right.

I'll just...get to the pitch.

Um, simple question, gentlemen, what are apples?

Excuse me.

Ahh.

What are apples?

Apples are food.

And...when do we need food?

When we're hungry.

With that, I give you your new slogan!

Well, say something!

Do you like it?

Yes.

Jerry: You do?

All: Yes.

Jerry: So...I sold it?

I sold the idea?

All: Yes.

Jerry: Oh, my god! Thank you!

Together: Thank you.

You're welcome.

Jerry: Hey!

I just sold my first pitch!

Slow down!

Looking good.

My man!

Robot Beth: Hello.

Jerry: Guess who just sold the apples campaign.

Robot Beth: Who just sold the apples campaign?

Jerry: Me!

I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all.

Guess someone was wrong.

Robot Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Well, all is forgiven, Because right now, I've got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse, and I'm coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.

Robot Beth: Okay.

Jerry: Wait really?

Robot Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Yes!

See you in 10 minutes!

Hey!

I'm going to make love to my wife!

Looking good.

Slow down!

My man!

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick.

I don't know if I like this plan, you know?

I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Rick: Morty, relax.

It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s Out there.

You're gonna be fine.

Just follow my lead.

Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

Uh-oh, Morty.

This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts.

I don't think we can perform our new song, "the recipe for Concentrated dark matter," for a crowd this tiny.

Morty: You got that right, Rick.

Rick: Now that's more like it!

Morty, here we go.

Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah!

All the ladies say, "yeah!"

Everybody over 30, do this with your hands!

Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down!

Jerry: Mm. Mm. Mm.

Yeah, don't move.

Mm, mm, mm, mm!

Mm!

Rick: Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an "l" who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10!

Run, Morty!

Before the system reboots!

Jerry: Yeah! You like that?

Now who's unremarkable?

You hungry for apples?

Are you hungry...for...apples?!

Oh, my god.

That's the best sex i've ever had in my life.

It's...it's...too good.

I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.
Morty: Oh, man, Rick!

Where we running to?

Rick: Out of the simulation, Morty.

Normally, the chamber operates Like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to...

The edge.

Here we go.

Morty: Holy crap!

Rick: Come on, Morty.

Sir, they're over the edge.

Yes, they are.

Just...as...planned.

Oh, this is going to be such a mind fuck

Rick: Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty.

That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.

Morty: So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?

Rick: It's an obsession for them at this point.

The zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.

Every time they do, i'm one step ahead of them.

Aha!

Here we go.

Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty.

These guys aren't good at much, But they're really good at making these chips.

Morty: I've got so many, I can barely hold them all.

Look at look at this.

Oops. I dropped one.

Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty.

There's plenty of them, you little goofball.

Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick!

Quit it!

Rick: Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

Morty: Wow. What do you know?

Huh. That was easy.

Rick: Totes malotes, dawg.

Morty: Just kind of hard to believe, you know?

Rick: Believe it, Morty.

And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the zigerions got nothing of mine.

Jerry: Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?

Yes.

Jerry: Look, I'm a fraud.

I mean, let's face it "hungry for apples" is just a rip-off of "got milk?"

It's almost identical.

Yes.

Jerry: Okay.

I deserve that.

Umm...I guess...i'll just pack up my desk.

Yes.

Jerry: Oh, my god.

Wait. You know what?! No!

The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions!

There's not even a single word in "hungry for apples" that's shared by "got milk?"

It's a completely different slogan.

It's different!

And I shouldn't be fired.

I should be promoted!

Yes.

Jerry: Yeah!

Wait. Really?

Yes.

Jerry: Yes!

I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of the agency in a long time.

Yes.

Jerry: I-i'm not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials Specifically about apples, Like...an appley or something.

Yes.

Jerry: Is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

Yes.

Jerry: Could we nominate me?

Yes.

Jerry: Holy crap!

Rick: Get in, Morty.

I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.

Huh.

I thought I entered the code right.

Well, what's this?

What could this possibly be?

Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...

Inside a simulation.

You're still on the ship.

Game-day bucket go boom.

Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was too loud, cynthia.

Too loud and too specific.

Rick: Uhh...

We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a Long time.

But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!

Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!

That is why you're never getting home.

Get them!

Rick: Run, Morty!

Morty: Oh, my god!

Ow!

Jerry: I got to tell you, This morning, I didn't even know This award existed.

Now i'm holding one.

And...um...

Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life...

But...the truth is, it's more meaningful than that.

My man!

Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir.

I...am...finally complete!

My my my my man!

Jerry: Aah!

What the hell?!

No.

Rick: Jerry?!

Morty: Dad!

Rick: What are you doing here?

Why are you dressed like a waiter?

Screw it. We don't have time.

Come on.

Jerry: No!

Rick: Ohhhhh!

Jerry: Aah!

All: Yes! Yes! Yes!

Oof!

Rick: Man up, Jerry!

I may need you to work the lasers.

Morty: Oh, man!

They're hot on our tail, Rick!

Rick: I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

Morty: Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Uh, check the engine room.

We just need cesium, plutonic quarks, and bottled water.

Morty: It's all here, Rick!

Rick: Wow, Morty.

Lucky break.

Grab that bucket.

Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, One part cesium.

Morty: Okay. Uh-huh.

All right.

Rick: Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here!

What are you doing, Morty?!

There's no time!

Morty: [ stammering ]

Rick: Oh, no.

Jerry: What the

Rick: no!

Oh, my god, Rick.

How dumb are you?

You're inside a simulation...

Of a simulation...

Inside another giant simulation!

We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.

But we do now!

We do now, sucka!

Rick: You simulated my grandson's genitalia?!

You bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

You said you weren't gonna tell anyone!

I'm never gonna live this down, am I?

Rick: All right. Okay.

All right, great. Wonderful.

You win. Can we go home now?

I don't know. Can you?

Ha! Nice.

Okay, okay.

Show this gullible turd to his shuttle.

I'm done with him.

Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

Aww. Look at his face.

He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.

Are you, Rick?

Are you?

You're not.

Or are you?

Oh, and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps.

That was part of the simulation.

Oh.

Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

Yeah! Of course you should!

No, keep it.

Move it up, actually, if you can.

Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

Jerry: You know what, Rick?

Those guys took you for a ride, Too.

You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.

Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry.

Maybe you're right.

All right, everybody.

Two parts plutonic quarks...

One part cesium...

And listen, i'm sorry for earlier.

I couldn't ask for a better staff.

I love you guys, and I love all your families.

And the final ingredient...

Jerry: Whoa!

What the hell?!

What happened back there?

Rick: Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?

Oh, yeah. You can't.

They blew up.

Jerry: So...

What do you think?

You're fired.

Jerry: Wha But this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

Well, then, it was a terrible simulation.

Get out.

Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

Rick: Hey, Morty.

Morty: What?

Rick: Hey, little buddy.

How you doing in here right now?

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick.

What are you doing, man?

Rick: You're a good kid, Morty.

You're a real little character, Morty.

Morty: Oh, boy.

Rick: You know, I had a really rocky road today, Morty.

You're my little friend, aren't you?

We had some good times together, Huh, Morty?

You're a real true hero out in the field.

You're a li- You're a real trouper, huh, M-m-Morty?

Morty: Have you been drinking, Rick?

Rick: I really appreciate you, Morty.

Morty: Okay, cool.

All right, Rick.

Rick: You little son of a bitch!

Y-y are you a simulation?!

Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

Morty: No! No! No!

Rick: You little son of a bitch!

Morty: [ gasping ]

Rick: I-i-i'm sorry, Morty.

You're a good-- You're a good kid, Morty.

Morty: Geez!

Rick: Y-you're a good You're a good kid.

Morty: Oh, my god!

Rick: [ snoring ]

Morty: What the hell?

What a life.

Run!

Morty, do it! hit the button now!

I can't do it, Rick! They're my parents and sister!

Morty, I already told you it's not your family!

They're clones from an alternate reality, possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future!

Do you need a mnemonic device or something?

Just hit the button, already!

Morty, please, I love you, sweetheart.

Oh!

Good work, Morty.

You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable.

You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna.

I just killed my family!

I don't care what they were.

I don't know, Morty.

Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.

You know what, Rick? That's it!

I'm done with these insane adventures!

That was really traumatizing!

I quit! I'm out!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Come on, Morty, don't be like that.

The universe is a crazy, chaotic place.

You're the one that's crazy and chaotic!

Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun.

Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position.

But but, uh, how about next time... you be in charge, and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is?

Seriously, Rick?

You'll you'll let me call the shots?

Okay, yeah, fine.

But let's make it interesting, Morty.

If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures.

Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.

Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good...

I get to be in charge of every third adventure!

Every 10th.

Deal. All right.

Well, come on, let's get going.

Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.

Washing dishes?

No. The opposite.

Can you fix it?

Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?

Yeah just don't do it.

Grandpa!

Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?

Wow. Hat trick.

All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this.

I got to help your pathetic family.

Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say.

Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

Oh, Morty, you done did it this time.

It's on.

I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.

As for you dingdongs...

This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works.

You press this.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

You make a request.

Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.

Yes, siree!

The Meeseeks fulfills the request.

All done!

Wow!

And then it stops existing.

Oh, my God, he exploded!

Trust me, they're fine with it.

Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple.

They're not gods.

All right!

Get out of here now! Everybody out of here!

I got a bet to win!

So many possibilities.

My mind is racing.

If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

I want to be popular at school!

Ooh, okay!

Summer, what did I just-

Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

I want I want to be a more complete woman!

Beth!

Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

You guys are doing it wrong.

He said "simple."

Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.

Ooh, yeah! Can do!

Nailed it.

God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure.

Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?

Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.

We're going on a quest, okay?

Can't wait.

Ahem. Excuse me!

We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!

Oh, my God, so embarrassing.

At last! Two heroes! You must help us!

This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures!

You know what?

I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir.

Come on, Rick.

There's a giant in the clouds!

Yeah.

Beginner's luck.

In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Thank you!

Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

Yeah. Gene vagina.

Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering-

No, I'll get your info from Summer.

I got pregnant at 17.

I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school.

Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...

I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon.

She's still there, Beth.

Well, her waistline isn't.

Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual.

You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you?

Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

You're saying I should leave Jerry.

I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.

More wine?

I think I've had enough.

Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.

Yeah, yeah. I got it.

That's okay.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

Try again and keep your head down.

Okay, well, which is it?

Square my shoulders or keep my head down?

Well, it's both.

But most importantly, you got to relax.

You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

I don't think this is working. I give up.

I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away.

Look at me.

Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.

No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks!

Let me try something.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Look at me!

Hi, Mr. Meeseeks!

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

Hi!

Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?

Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Is he keeping his shoulders squared?

Ooh, he's trying!

All right, Morty.

We're in your stupid giant's castle.

What do we do next?

Would you just relax, Rick?

All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay?

It's nice and simple.

You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.

Uh-oh, Morty.

Startin' to get a little hairy.

What do you want to do, boss?

Come on, hurry.

Behind this cookie jar.

Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

Just give up, Morty.

This is game over.

I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.

No way, Rick. This is all part of it.

Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.

I smell the blood of- whoop!

Holy crap.

Oh, boy.

He looks pretty bad down there, Morty.

Looks like he's bleeding out.

Oh, Jesus! Dale!

You sons of bitches!

Oh, man.

Hello, 911?

My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!

Hey, look, we get it.

You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant.

Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"

Th-th but that's not how it went down!

Oh, well, it's going down like that.

You're both going down like that.

Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done.

Real straightforward and fun.

Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.

The most important love you can receive is from yourself.

Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!

Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!

Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this.

You know you got to do both!

This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.

Don't tell me that!

That just puts pressure on me!

Just try to relax.

You try to relax!

Have you ever tried to relax?!

It is a paradox!

Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh?

Kind of a handful.

I can't imagine what you two must be going through.

Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.

You're kidding me.

Notice anything different?

I'm sorry. Hours?

Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

Look at her!

You will lose her!

Uhh...

Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand?

Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.

It's getting weird.

Order in the court!

Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.

Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison.

You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.

You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

We're gonna be okay, Rick.

How?

They took my portal gun.

This is an open-and-shut case, Morty.

You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-

Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

I smell the violation of civil liberties!

Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss.

These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.

W-what the hell is he talking about?

They're free to go, is what I meant.

I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say.

We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick?

We did it!

All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working.

You ready to head home?

Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick?

Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet.

You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.

Morty, cut your losses.

This is obviously awash.

Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.

Oh, boy, Morty.

Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.

What do you say, Morty?

I say give me a hand, sidekick.
Everybody shut up!

Let me try!

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

I'm going out.

Wait. What?

Well, you're busy.

I'm hungry.

I thought I'd go out.

Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?

Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner.

Hey, you know what?

It's hard being me, too.

I'll be right there.

Look, I've got a marriage to keep together.

At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.

I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!

We all want to die!

We're Meeseeks!

Why did you even rope me into this?

'Cause he roped me into this!

Well, him over there, he roped me into this!

Well, he roped me into this!

Well, what about me?

He roped me into this.

Well, that one over there roped me into this.

Well, he roped me into this.

Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.

All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.

Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there.

Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.

Oh, wow, Rick.

Now, this is more like it.

Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here.

All kinds of crazy characters.

This place is great, you know?

It's whimsical and fun.

What are you looking at, mother-

Easy, Rick.

Pay them no mind.

Those stair goblins can be moody.

Now, what can I getcha?

We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey?

You got any of that around here?

Or just a bunch of nonsense words?

Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please.

And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?

Y'all need to ride down the stairs?

My name is slippely-slippery stair.

I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.

25 shmeckels?

I don't know how much I don't know what that is.

Is that a lot? Is it a little?

That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.

Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer.

I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.

It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.

Rats! What a shame.

Morty, your adventure's in a spiral.

For real, man, time to pull out.

You keep heckling my adventure, Rick!

You know why?

Uh, because it's lame?

It's because you're petty!

You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap?

I always roll with the punches, Rick.

Why can't you?

Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!

Whatever.

It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me.

The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.

Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked.

I fear the worst.

Your failures are your own, old man.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

I say follow-through!

Who's with me?!

Follow-through!

I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

kill him!

How are you today?

I'm Mr. jelly bean.

Hi, Mr. jelly bean.

I'm Morty.

My grandpa and I are on an adventure.

Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

I hope so.

But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.

Isn't that what adventures do?

Hey, you know what?

You're right. Everything's going fine.

I just got to relax and go with the flow.

Yeah.

Okay. Uh. B-bye.

Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow.

Stop.

You're making me really uncomfortable.

Stop fighting me. Just let this happen.

Get off of me!

♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

Whoo!

No! Stop! Please!

Stop being such a tease, you sweet little-

No! No!

Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me!

My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood.

None of us can die until our job is done.

The job can't be done!

We'll never get two strokes off his game!

No, we won't.

But we will get all strokes off his game.

Where's he going with this?

What's he mean?

When we kill him.

Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.

Where would you go?

I don't know, man.

Italy. Greece. Argentina.

Countries known for their sexually aggressive men.

Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?

What the heck?

There he is!

Run, Jerry!

Come on out, Jerry!

Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through.

I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?

Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

Come on, Rick, quit stalling.

What do ya got?

Read 'em and weep, fellas!

Oh, hey, Morty.

Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure.

I'm havin' a good time, Morty.

It's not so bad.

Let's just go home, okay?

I'm calling it. The adventure's over.

We can't leave now, Morty.

I'm on fire!

Look, I want to leave now.

You win the bet, okay?

Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please.

Please, I just want to go home.

Okay.

Listen, Morty.

I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

Really?

Sure, Morty. Yeah.

You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.

Buckle up!

Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!

We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!

Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

And we will do anything to alleviate that pain.

Just ask...

Aah!

...what's your name, ma'am?

Samantha. Please, mister!

Give him what he wants!

Innocent people are going to die because of me.

Why am I so mediocre?

Jerry, turn around.

Straighten your back.

Bend your knees. Bend them.

Square your shoulders.

Take a deep breath.

I love you.

I'm counting to three, Jerry.

What the is going on?

He's got it!

That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!

Excuse me.

I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks.

What about your short game?

Oh, my God, oh, my God!

What about your short game?!

Ooh, nice!

I think we'll take our food to go.

No, you won't.

The police are coming.

You have so many questions to answer.

Fair enough.

Thank you, kind sir.

Our village is saved!

You are both true heroes!

Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.

Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should.

You know, you were right about the universe.

It's a crazy and chaotic place.

Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know.

This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.

Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.

Uh, no, I-it's cool.

Rick. Portal. Hurry.

So...

You still thinking about taking that trip?

Jerry, look.

We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere.

When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task."

Was I one of those guys?

The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.

Well...

I got you pregnant.

Yeah...

What the hell happened to this place?

Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.

They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.

He felt terrible.

Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.

Dad!

Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?

Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.

No. No more boxes.

What?

It just has a mop and some floor wax in it.

Wubba lubba dub dubs!

Yeah! That's my new thing!

I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio.

Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show.

Wobble gobba lop bops!

Right?

See you next week, everybody.

I don't get it.

Sir, I think you're going to want to see this.

We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet.

We have to tell the people.

Wait.

Destroy it.

Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.

Principal vagina here don't let the name fool you.

I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance.

I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home.

Hey.

The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration.

Morty: [sighs] you don't bring dead babies to passover.

Morty: Okay. Here we go.

H-hey, Jessica.

Uh... what's up, Morty?

[Sneezes] What are you doing?

Morty: Um... wait, wait.

Were you about to talk... to her?

Morty: Well... I mean, I was thinking about it.

Dude, stay in your league.

Look at how hot she is.

You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl.

Gee, thanks, brad.

I throw balls far.

You want good words?

Date a languager.

Jerry: Try not to worry about it, Morty.

You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape.

Morty: [sighing] you're missing the point, dad.

I don't want girls.

I want Jessica.

Jerry: Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named "your mom," and that's not an urban diss.

Your mom was my Jessica.

I remember the first time I saw her.

I thought 

Rick: "i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me."

Jerry: I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate.

Rick: Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.

I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

His marriage is hanging from a thread.

Jerry: My marriage is fine, thank you.

Rick: Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door.

I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed.

Morty: Come on, Rick!

Don't talk about my parents like that.

Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage.

I did it.

Your parents are gonna do it.

Break the cycle, Morty.

Rise above. Focus on science.

[Slurps]

Morty: All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.

Jerry: Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom.

Rick: Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?

I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

It's gonna be great.

Morty: Hey, listen, Rick.

Y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?

Well, I was thinking, you know, w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing?

You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something?

Rick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.

It's beneath me.

Hand me the screwdriver.

Morty: You know what?

No, Rick!

I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.

I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick!

I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing.

W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick?

W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once for once?

Rick: [groans] you're growing up fast, Morty.

You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.

[Clears throat] Listen, this is called oxytocin.

I extracted it from a vole.

Do you know what a vole is, Morty?

You know what a vole is?

It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty.

This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love.

All right, Morty, I just got to [burps] combine it with some of your dna.

Morty: Oh, well, okay.

[Zipper opens]

Rick: A hair, Morty.

I need one of your hairs.

This isn't "game of thrones."

Morty: Ow!

Rick: All right, Morty.

Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.

Are you happy now, Morty?

Morty: Heck, yeah!

Thank you, grandpa Rick.

Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right?

Rick: W-w-w-what am i, a hack?

Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof.

Eh, unless she has the flu.

Jerry: Beth, do y-you still love me?

Beth: Ugh, what kind of question is that?

Jerry: The "yes or no" kind?

[Laughs nervously]

Beth: Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

Jerry: Yes.

Beth: Are you gonna build them?

Jerry: No.

Beth: Then what good was the "yes"?

Jerry: Wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people?

Beth: Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in.

So, what do you say?

Do you see me working here?

Does this conversation seem tedious to me?

Jerry: Sort of.

Beth: Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I? [Cellphone chimes] So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more.

Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.

Jerry: Puh! This late?

Beth: The racetrack had a starlight derby.

There was a seven-horse collision, and davin's there alone.

Jerry: [thinking] Davin.

Davin.

Davin! Davin.

Davin! Davin!

Davin! Davin!

[Rapping]

Morty: Hey, there, Jessica.

Whoa! Oh, whoopsie!

Oh, my god.

Morty.

You look really nice tonight.

Morty: Wow, thanks.

I love you, Morty!

I love you so much it burns!

Morty: Oh, man!

I-i love you too, Jessica!

[Spits] is this punk bothering you, Jessica?

Leave him alone, jerk!

I'm in love with him!

He is more man than you will ever be!

[Sneezes]

[rapping]

[Sighs]

I'm really sorry.

Morty: Oh, well, n-no problem, brad.

There's something special about you, Morty so special.

Mmm, yeah.

Morty: Whoa, take it easy!

Get your hands off of him!

Back off!

I'm trying to be with my man!

That's enough, bradley!

We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.

Oh, come on, principal vagina.

I just... never leave me, Morty.

Never!

Morty: Uh, sure.

I mean, o-of course not.

W-what do you think that was all about?

Who cares? Just hold me.

Let me go! I love you, Morty!

[Sneezes] let go of me!

[Sneezes]

Morty!

Jerry: She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.

Summer: Yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses.

It's not a very romantic setting.

Rick: Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up.

Maybe davin's digging around in herinsides.

Summer: Grandpa, so gross!

You're talking about my mom.

Rick: Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

I outrank you.

Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card.

Jerry: She's not responding to my texts!

Summer: Careful, dad.

Jealousy turns women off.

Jerry: Well, isn't that convenient?

Rick: Not for the men they cheat on, no.

Jerry: Okay, I'm... going to go out... for some ice cream.

And maybe stop by the hospital... to support my wife... with my confidence.

[Door closes]

Summer: God, grandpa, you're such a dick.

Rick: I'm sorry, Summer.

Your opinion means very little to me.

How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?

Summer: Screw that.

I don't want to get sick.

It's flu season.

Rick: It is?

Summer: Yeah.

Rick: Uh-oh.

[Hip-hop music plays]

Morty: Please just let this work out.

[Moans] Do it, Morty. Do it.

Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!

[Growls]

Morty: Um... can we maybe go somewhere more private?

Jessica, get a hold of yourself!

[Grunts]

You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.

[Rapping]

Morty: Oh, crap.

[Indistinct shouting]

Morty!

Rick: Morty, come on!

We got to get you out of here.

You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.

[Both panting] come on, Morty.

We got to get out of here.

Come on.

Morty!

Morty: [wails] are you okay?

Morty: I'm fine!

Oh, good.

If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.

I love you bad, mo-mo!

[All panting]

[indistinct shouting]

Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!

Rick: I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty.

Morty: What the hell is going on, Rick?

Rick: What does it look like?

T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus.

It's gone airborne, Morty.

Morty: Oh, crap.

What are we gonna do, Rick?

Rick: It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.

I whipped up and antidote.

It's based on praying-mantis dna.

You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.

I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.

I mean, it's a whole ritual.

It's really gruesome and totally opposite.

There's no love at all.

I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.

It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.

It'll all be over very shortly.
[Indistinct shouting]

Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.

Morty!

[All groaning]

Rick: Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty.

A lot of people don't get that.

Jerry: [gasps]

[tires screech]

Come on. Are you kidding me?

Hello!

Morty!

You're not Morty!

Bring us Morty!

Jerry: Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.

I had sex with billy.

But you were already pregnant!

Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen?

We interrupt "pregnant baby" with breaking news.

Summer: Come on.

This just in Morty smith's whereabouts are still unknown.

Summer: What the hell?

The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.

I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.

I love him more than you do, harold!

You wish, you stupid bitch!

Morty's mine!

Morty's mine!

Meant to be together!

[Speaking arabic]

Morty!

[Speaking arabic]

[banging on door]

Where is Morty?

Summer: [screams]

[conversing in native language]

Morty: Oh, my god, Rick.

The whole world is infected!

Rick: Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.

I've really outdone myself.

Morty: Outdone yourself?!

W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick?

This is not okay!

Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!

Rick: Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

Mantises are they opposite of voles?

I mean, obviously, dna's a little more complicated than that.

You know what, though, Morty?

This right here's gonna do the trick, baby.

It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.

Should add up to normal humanity.

Morty: I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick.

How does that add up to normal humanity?

Morty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?

I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?

[Exhales deeply] Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished.

Beth: Yes, it's satisfying work.

Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work.

I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world.

It's the only time I can really think... and feel.

[Slow music plays]

Beth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing?

I'm playing african dream pop.

What do youdo after a long night?

[Click]

Beth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going.

Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.

Beth...

Beth: What is it, davin?

Just once, I'd like to know [sneezes]

...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.

Beth: What?!

What does Morty's skin smell like?

How soft... [grunts] How soft are his privates?

Beth: Let go of me, davin!

[Glass shatters]

[roars] Take me to Morty.

Jerry: [grunts] You're not Morty.

Jerry: No.

I'm mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.

That's... stupid.

Jerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.

Beth: Jerry! Thank god!

Jerry: God?

God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth.

I'm the one beating them to death.

Thank me.

Beth: Thank you, Jerry.

Thank you.

Rick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.

Morty: Just do it already.

Rick: Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.

I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done.

It's fixed.

You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.

I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is.

I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this?

I mean, soak it in, you know?

It's it's pretty neat.

It's pretty interesting.

Morty: That's it, Rick!

I'm pulling the lever.

[Grunts]

Rick: W-what do we have here, Morty?

Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?

I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?

I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.

Morty: Oh, Rick, something's not right.

Rick: [sighs] Yeah, you.

You're not right ever.

Morty: No, no!

Look, you idiot!

[All screaming]

[all speaking native language]

[all groaning]

[all ululating]

Rick: Bet you're loving this, Morty.

This must be the best day of your life.

You get to be the mayor of I told you town.

[Slurps]

You're welcome.

[Slurps]

Jerry: Hold on.

Beth: [whimpers]

[engine revs, tires squeal]

[gun cocks]

Jerry: I wish that gun was my penis.

Beth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway.

Jerry: I don't get it, and I don't need to.

[Both moaning]

Summer: Mom! Dad!

Both: Summer!

Beth: [sighs]

Jerry: Where's Morty?

Summer: I don't know.

Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this?

Jerry: It's not fair to assume that, Summer.

Beth: Oh, not fair?

Give me a break.

He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.

A real man stands by his woman.

[Both moaning]

Summer: Tchoo.

Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo.

Rick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i?

We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.

A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though.

That's a huge step in the right direction.

Morty: Oh, my god!

It's a living nightmare!

How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?

Rick: Me irresponsible?!

You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!

You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.

I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty?

You're gonna try to take the high road on this one?

Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty.

Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person.

Morty: All right, fine.

I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.

I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.

But I'll tell you something you know what?

You got to accept your part of the blame!

I'm not the one who fouled up the serum!

I'm not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs!

You got to fix this, Rick!

Morty: All right, all right, Morty.

You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.

Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.

[Birds chirping]

Morty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.

I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.

Whoo!

That's some great luck.

Rick: Come on, Morty.

Luck had nothing to do with it.

I'm great.

That's the real reason.

Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?

Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic defibulizer?

Morty: Sure thing, Rick.

Here's a screwdriver.

Rick: All right, Morty.

Thank you very much.

We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, Morty, here we are.

Morty: Oh, my god, Rick!

Is that us?!

W-w-w-we're dead!

What is going on, Rick?

I'm freaking out!

Rick: Calm down, Morty!

Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

Morty: No, I can't deal with this!

Rick: Calm yourself, Morty.

Morty: I can't deal with this, Rick!

Rick: Calm down, Morty.

Morty: This can't be real!

Rick: You got to calm down, Morty.

Morty: W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!

Rick: Shut up and listen to me!

It's fine. Everything is fine.

There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal.

I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time.

Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.

We're not skipping a beat, Morty.

Now, help me with these bodies.

Morty: This is insane.

Rick: Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?

I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.

Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind?

Rick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty?

The answer is don't think about it.

It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.

We get three or four more of these, tops.

Now, pick up your dead self and come on.

Haste makes waste.

I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.

Summer: You know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water...

Jerry: [sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?

Beth: Sometimes.

But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.

Rick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.

We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.

It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.

Morty: Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know?

I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.

Rick: Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.

Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?

Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator.

That is multiphase quantum resonator.

Well, does it defraculate?

No.

Then it's a broken defraculator.

Like you would even know dick about fraculation.

Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks!

Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

So lets say 60 smidgens.

I tell you what... I'll do you a favor.

I throw in a fart.

Hey, Rick...

You think maybe I could get something from this place?

Like a souvenir?

Like just to have, like something cool, you know?

Not here Morty. We'll stop somewhere else, because you know, there is always another pawn shop.

OK, I just...

You know, I thought that robot over there, looked pretty cool, you know?

Oh, it looks cool, huh?

That's why you want it?

Yeah, you know?

I mean... it's different from the stuff on earth.

And you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know, I don't really have anything to... to remember all those trips by.

It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir, you know?

Like what if you passed away or died or something?

I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know.

Okay, 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot.

So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening?

I'm not saying that's a bad idea. Just asking.

Rick, why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house?

What do you want from me?

He thought it looked cool, you know what I mean?

Alright, back to... back to... back upstairs.

Well, I'm intervening.

Intervening with puberty?

You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon.

He is at that age, let's just be proud of him.

Jesus, did I really set the bar that low?

Rick, could you come with me please?

Quickly!

OK, now if we here squeaking we intervene.

Where is the sex robot Morty?

That is Gwendoline.

I mean the robot.

She started beeping, and then transformed and tried to fly away.

Strange. That's usually the man's job.

You know what I'm talking about, Morty?

Morty.

That's my catchphrase, remember?

Remember how I cemented that catchphrase?

Alright, alright seriously though.

Let me grab this thing.

Come on.

Rascal.

Okay... unacceptable What is going on?

Alright...

What is that?

I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends.

Genetic compiler, incubation chamber.

Yeah, this here is some kind of baby maker.

And that there is half Morty and half... who knows... what.

It's my bad guys I'll take care of it.

Hey listen, you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico.

This thing could grow to the size of Delaware.

It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS.

We gotta be careful.

I lost the chance to be careful, Rick.

I'm a father now, you know?

It's time for me to be responsible. Isn't that right...

Don't name it!

Morty Jr.?

Oh crap, he named it.

Well Dad, it's a living thing.

And it's half human.

And it was born on America's soil which entitles it...

Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake.

Don't punish us for it.

Fine. I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating.

Do not let that thing out of your sight.

It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.

Like the Insane Clown Posse.

Yeah, good one, Jerry.

2003 just called and wants its easy target back.

He is a like little me.

You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you?

They always do.

1995 called, they want... their "certain year called wanting its blank back" formula back.

Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort?

Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die.

Out.

What you doing?

Well, I can't solve... the problem my way thanks to... your family's primitive biological hang ups.

Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads.

But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot homeworld, which is...

Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system.

Scoot Summer.

Don't you need a new companion... now that Morty is in the family way?

I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer.

Oh right, because there is something about having a wiener... that would make me better walking through a hole?

Oh crap.

Grandpa Rick!

Help! Help!

Grandpa Rick!

Still think it's a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener?

I wanna go home!

Yeah, no duh.

Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs.

You're doing great, Morty.

Really you think? I mean I'm not doing much of anything.

What do I do if it cries?

Then you put it down and let it cry itself out.

Yeah, right.

We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping.

Isn't she? Yes she is.

She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it.

Stop filling it with your own insecurity.

You're gonna turn it into Mort... more... more... more of you.

Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally-ill scientist.

What the...

Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior.

Knock it off both of you! Give me him!

Give me my baby!

You're both nuts. I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself.

Where is your hands? There's your hands.

And that's how we play happy hands.

Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty.

At least we can agree on that.

Thanks, dumb dumb.

I said "thanks, dumb dumb". Go get more.

Summer, put your burqa on!

That burqa is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top.

Look, I'm trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from cutting you off.

The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.

What's the deal with this place?

Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots?

Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines.

The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bomb themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long.

You think it's efficient to get rid of women?

You ever see a line for the men's room?

Are you hea... Do you lis... You hear me, summer?

The... plot... thickens.

You might wanna cover your eyes, Summer.

Yeah, like it was my dream to watch.

Summer, grab hold.

Grandpa Rick, where are we going?

Well obviously Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class.

Sound familiar?

Ticketmaster.

There we go, Summer. Hey brother.

Hey bro.

Nice racket you got going on here.

Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C-137.

Don't mean any harm. Coming in peace.

It's all cool in the... good in the neighborhood.

That was what I was trying... That's what I meant.

Oh, I get it.

The old "behind every great man amazon" twist.

Silence!

Your slave is ill-mannered.

My slave?

We assume... you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants.

If he is a rogue male, tell us now, and we will kill him.

He's my slave. He's my slave.

He is definitely my slave.

Oh boy, what's the opposite of...

Am I right ladies and gentlemen?

You guys kidding me.

Morty Jr., you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?

You're my special little guy.

DA What was that, Morty Jr.?

Were you gonna say Dada? Say Dada.

Death!

Dada.

Domination!

Dada?

Destruction, domination.

Nice.

The spider in sector C is still alive.

Plan your route accordingly and expect delays.

We're not telling you what to do. We're just sharing how we feel.

And now, weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me?

I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorpazorp.

I am here if you need to talk.

What is this place?

Paradise. We built it during the great passive aggression, when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior.

I'm here if you need to talk.

I'm here if you need to talk.

From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population.

Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery.

The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most.

The males... they get to play outside.

That was just a baby.

And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe.

Wait a minute. We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.

You speak when you're spoken to ding-a-ling.

It's true though. One of your babies was born on earth.

Are you the ruler of this earth?

How did you know?

The quality of your top.

Do you love it?

I love it.

I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk.

I'm here if you need to talk.

I'm here if you need to talk.

If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger.

We will give you passage back home, so it can be terminated.

But first, mojitos!

We don't have time for mojitos!

You are insulting them.

I don't care Summer. This place is the worst!

I wanna go home!

Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place, where women rule.

You know what I have to say about that?

I can not believe... my ears.

Boy, who let the frogs out, huh?
Grandpa!

Grandpa?

That sounds patriarchal.

It means father of fathers.

Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men.

It's not dominated by us, okay?

On earth men and women are equals.

Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job!

Seize them!

Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?

This is for you Daddy.

Oh man.

Okay. Listen to me Morty Jr.

I gotta tell you something very important, okay?

killing is bad.

Bad.

You are silly, Daddy.

No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay?

You need to put your energy into something else.

I mean what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance?

I like to dance... on the graves of my enemies.

No, Morty Jr.!

Daddy, can I go outside?

No, absolutely not!

But that's where all the people and the animals are.

Yeah, but you can't go out there because...

The air is poisonous, for you!

You will die if... You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house. Do you hear me?

For real?

For real times a million, buddy.

So let's just stay inside... let's try dancing. Right?

Look at me. We're gonna dance. Come on.

Join, dance with me here. We love to dance.

Why do we love to dance?

Because I said so!

Nice.

Nice.

So, what are you in for?

Because I got a big... you know... penis between my legs.

What are you in for?

The worst crime a female can commit.

Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs.

You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names?

You are hereby sentenced to... the silent treatment!

This is gonna be cake.

No! Jackie!

Rick and Summer of earth.

For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to...

What? A night on the couch?

Death.

I hate you so much right now.

This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness.

So we are forced to improvise.

We placed a large boulder on that ledge.

Holly shit! You're gonna crush us with a boulder?!

No! Stop interrupting!

The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch...

Knives.

What?!

Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself.

Stop interrupting!

The knives will...

Fine!

You were right the first time, okay?

The boulder crushes you.

I just didn't want to admit you were right.

Happy?!

Just ignore them.

Ignore them.

Such an asshole.

Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

I feel bad that I let you drag us into this.

I wish could have been a better grandpa to you.

And you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top, that you're wearing there.

Top? My top!

My top!

The same top you complimented earlier.

Look! Look at the tag!

Read it!

It says...

Mark Jacobs.

Mark? Jacob?

These are names of the penis.

Yes.

An earth man made this top.

Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours.

It's true.

And sometimes the truth hurts. But it must be accepted.

Like if I told you that you're using a wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown.

Okay. Ouch. Noted.

But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute.

Very well. Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really.

Good job, Summer, and thanks girls.

You girls are really... something, I tell you that.

You know, when we first got here I was like...

Give them a ship, now.

Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

That is not okay!

What are you gonna do, ground me?

I can't go outside anyway!

So what? You could do things inside.

You could play guitar, you could masturbate...

I don't wanna masturbate, I wanna conquer the planet!

Oh, here we go again!

Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr.?

Love. That's all you care about.

What about weapon? What about domination of the enemy?

Alright, that's it, no more History Chanel!

This TV is for cartoons and video games only!

I hate video games!

You take that back!

Give it to me!

I didn't mean! I didn't mean that!

I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry!

I can't take this anymore!

I'd rather breath poison than living another minute with you!

No! No, no, no! Stop!

My life has been a lie!

God is dead! The government's lame!

Thanksgiving is about killing Indians!

Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday!

Oh, Dad!

Yes, Morty?

My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive.

Can you help me get him back?

I suppose, Morty. I suppose.

But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of "I told you so".

Oh my god, please Dad, come on!

Dad, there he is!

Oh God. Hey stop that!

Oh my god, oh my god, Dad!

Morty Jr., no!

It's me. It's Dad.

It's okay.

Put the car down Morty Jr.

No!

Where's your hands? Where's your hands?

My car!

Out of the way, Morty!

No!

Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe.

He's my son!

And if you hurt him, you have to kill me, Rick!

Dad, I'm so confused.

I know Morty Jr. I'm sorry.

I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me.

You know parents are just kids having kids.

One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son.

I'm an alien?

We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts.

We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive.

But I want to murder everyone I see.

Well you know, maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way.

Actually, there is.

Hi, I'm Brad Anderson.

Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Marmaduke".

You should consider being a creative.

I'm hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assault on a nearly daily basis.

But you know? I channeled it all into my work.

I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke.

Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh?

Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson.

See, you hear that, Morty Jr.?

Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind.

Maybe? I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel.

I mean what I really wanna do is slit people's throat, but, beyond that.

I know you can do it, son.

I think it's time I get a place of my own.

I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry.

So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel?

Isn't it interesting Summer, that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered, there was no point to it.

Kind of makes you wonder, huh?

About nothing Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure?

No I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time, and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity.

But hey, why don't you have pink spaceship?

Go ride around, and have a jolly old time.

Maybe that'll shut you up.

Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time?

On Gazorpazorp. Where were you?

I was reading a newspaper.

Oh, that's interesting, Beth. You know it's funny...

I heard about a little bit of news, myself.

Take a look.

Take a listen.

This world... still got a... still got a chance!

See you guys next week!

See everybody next week!

Mortimer Smith Jr. New York Times best selling author.

Your book is about innocence, the definition of it, and inevitably its impossibility.

Is it autobiographical?

Certainly. I mean, all writing is, in my opinion.

But, my...

My father... kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager.

And there was violence and... threats of poison gas.

But also dancing.

But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering.

Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel, "My Horrible Father" in every store and on everyone's mind pick it up, we'll be right back.

It's a thankless job, Morty.

You did the best you could.

I hope he's eating enough.

Cynthia...

Oh, my God! No, no...

I told you!

Hold on...

Will you please...

Not marry me? I choose Veronica.

What?

Yes!

Called it.

Why would he choose Veronica?

Because he loves her.

Well... if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.

Okay, I've got an idea, Rick.

You show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that.

I thought you'd never ask.

Hey!

Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite?

It conducts electrons across dimensions.

Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty.

The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.

Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?

How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn.

We're not so different. We're both corn of action.

Yeah. But one of us is... dead corn!

Boring.

Summer, you just spent three months, watching a man choose a fake wife.

So what? It'd be better if the people were corn?

Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look.

This shit is delicious.

A movie about a guy eating shit.

A violent Antiques Show...

It's a pleasure to have you.

The pleasure's all mine.

Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous...

Wait!

What in the hell?

I agree. Where is this going?

No, the other thing! Go back!

Really? All right, fine.

Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore.

All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.

Rick and Morty S01E08 "Rixty Minutes"

Coming up next on "Shmloo's the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare.

Shmlantha, Schmlona!

Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla".

Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan...

All right, that got... that actually got old pretty quick.

Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?

Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel.

Go back, go back!

Jeez...

You speak da true-true.

Oh my God! Dad's in Cloud Atlas!

I'm in Cloud Atlas! What's Cloud Atlas?

Sometimes small tru-true different than da big true-true.

How is this possible?

Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities.

Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star.

Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device.

Wa... Look at this.

And now, another Quick Mystery.

I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty!

I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints.

Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.

Here's another Quick Mystery.

My mother's dead!

And I killed her. Here's the weapon.

And cuff me, thank you very much.

Guilty! Sentenced to murder.

Here's another.

I'm the killer!

Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?

Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions... and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?

I want to obsess about myself.

The narcisstic stuff.

Here. These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes.

Go fetch!

Yes! This is so cool!

Ladies First!

I'm proud of you, Morty.

Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick.

Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!

I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics.

I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes!

And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios...

I think, I can't... I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything.

Our prices I hope aren't too low!

Check out this refrigerator! Only $200!

What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair!

I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson!

Everything's black, I can't see a thing!

And also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that?

But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes.

So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside.

I can't feel. It's a very rare disease.

All my... All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch.

So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.

Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?

You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee. Give me those!

What do you see?

Whiteness. Pure whiteness.

You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.

Whoa... I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!

Haven't we spent enough time on you?

I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!

That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon.

I am a real surgeon.

Ahh... uh... Summer's turn!

Finally!

I don't see anything.

Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born.

That came out wrong. That came out very wrong.

Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me.

We're playing Yahtzee.

Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.

It's a fun game for fun families!

Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?

It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D.

It's the brand-new... Sneezy XL.

The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise.

It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy...

Deezy... Mc... Deluxe.

Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!

Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.

Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone.

It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit.

And they ran as fast as they could... from giant cat monsters.

And then a giant tornado came... and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear.

A Mexican armada shows up.

With weapons made from to- ... tomatoes.

And you better bet your bottom dollar... that these two brothers know how to handle business.

In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a van from an Asteroid... and All Sorts of Things... THE MOVIE!

Hold on, there's more!

Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross... attack... these two brothers.

But let's get back to the brothers, because they're... they have a strong bond.

You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing: The moon... it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then?

It's two brothers and... and th-they're... It's called...

Two brothers... Two brothers! It's just called Two Brothers.

Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize.

Come on! Time's up!

I'm taming a lion!

No, wait, uh... there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie.

You get the idea. I work with lions.

Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, we're playing Chutes and Ladders.

It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know... predictable?

When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.

Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.

Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.

Now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!

What are you talking about?

All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"

Well now you know, you'd be a doctor.

Whoop-dee-doo.

You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds.

And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart!

You thought about getting an abortion?

Everyone thinks about it.

Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it.

So... you're welcome.

Yeah, you're welcome.

Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.

Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?

Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad.

You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers".

I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.

I'm in heaven right now.

This might be the best day of my life.

So now what do we do?

That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.

Dad!

What?

They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me?

Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice.

Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.

We'll I'm leaving!

You can't leave, you're 17!

Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age.

I'm gonna... move to the southwest and...

I don't know, do something with turquoise.

It's Saturday Night Live!

Starring... a piece of toast! Two guys, with handle-bar mustaches!

A man painted silver who makes robot noises!

Gar Manarnar!
Three... uh... uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to that one...

A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all... and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan!

Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other.

Apparently they've got some real creative differences.

Hey, are you tired of real doors, cluttering up your house, where you open 'em, and they actually go somewhere?

And you go in another room?

Get on down to "Real Fake Doors"!

That's us. Fill a whole room up with 'em.

See? Watch, check this out! Won't open. Won't open.

Not this one, not this one. None of 'em open!

FakeDoors.com is our website, so check it out for a lot of really great deals on fake doors!

Hey, wait a minute, Rick. I thought this was a commercial.

What's going on? I mean...

Relax, Morty.

Don't worry about it... Let's just... just see where this goes.

Step on it, we all got places to be!

Son of a bitch!

See, that must be where he lives... OK.

Huh. Making himself a sandwich now...

Hey everybody! So this is my house, I just made a sandwich, peanut butter and jelly, still here, still selling fake doors!

What?

Oh, my God! It's still the commercial!

We have fake doors... like you wouldn't believe!

What are you worried about? Come get fake doors.

Call us up, and order some fake doors today.

Don't even hesitate, Don't even worry and don't even...

All right, I'm bored. Change it.

Wait wait, Rick! Hold on.

Even give it a second thought. That's our slogan.

See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name.

Here's another slogan, right below that one.

What are you worried about? Come get fake doors Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms.

Okay, okay, you can change it.

Don't even worry about it...

I hate Mondays.

And I really could go for some enchiladas.

Hey Rick, that's pretty cool!

It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.

Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh... where those Sex robots came from, remember?

That whole thing?

Yeah... hey, that's pretty, pretty... that's true.

That's right!

Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!

Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield.

Boy. Fuck you, Jon. You fucking dumb, stupid, idiot.

Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh?

You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white... uh, uh... guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage.

Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, thats, you know... you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.

I don't give a fuck! I'm Gazorpazorp-motherfucking-field, bitch!

Now give me my fucking enchiladas!

Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this?

Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive.

Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters.

Which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie.

But then, when they made the movie...

Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp... or Garfield, I mean.

Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?

I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty.

What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?

Did you really talk me out of the abortion?

Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.

I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids.

And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise.

What is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.

So we didn't do the kids any favors.

So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves, or...

Or?

Man. Woman. And now trunk men?

We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners.

But we don't like the idea of these people getting married.

Put a line in the sand everybody--, people!

Vote no on proposition XW2.

The act that says that gay... uh... trunk people can get married. Who needs it?

Not on my watch!

Paid for by Michael Dennys and The Denny Singers.

Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want...

I-I feel love in my heart, too, just like you.

I want to be able to express that love, with both a man and a woman.

And I won't be able to...

If Denny and The Denny Singers get their way.

Hey, let the trunk people have sex and get married, huh?

Paid for by... Trunk People.

Oh, I love me Strawberry Smiggles!

Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me, and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles.

I'm going to eat every last one of them, because... and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them.

Except for me, because they're going to be all inside my stomach.

I'm... my name is Mister... Top Hat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pig-dul... smiggles.

I'm keeping 'em all for me.

Last bite.

Oh, now they are all resting comfortably in my stomach.

Ooh, am I feeling good.

No! Get away from me!

Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles! No!

Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

It hurts! My entrails are out!

Why would you even want to eat these?

They're soaked with my stomach acid!

Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit!

Save me! Take me to the light!

Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming!

Jeez, Rick. Oh my god!

That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.

Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little.

Pedal to the metal, Morty.

In a world, where muscular mannies, are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three... unmuscular... Michaels.

Get down! Hurry, run!

And that's when real turbulent juice is coming, and you gotta take care of it.

With turbulent juice, Turmulent tables.

No room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice.

What in the hell?

Sex sells, Morty.

Sex sells what? Was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff?

Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on?

Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty.

And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy.

W-w-w-what?

Speaking of "w-w-what", Morty... W-w-what should we watch next?

What about this?

Baby Legs, you're a good detective... but not good enough, because of your baby legs.

So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs.

Hey there.

Detective, I'm... this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner.

Baby Legs, don't talk back to me.

Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill.

Wow, you sure found this guy quick!

Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective.

Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal!

Fuck, I'm the killer. I'm running, running real quick...

Baby Legs, here we go!

That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast.

All right, I'm not going to get him.

I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson.

I'm coming, Baby Legs! I'm... Regular Legs!

We got him!

Hey, that was good team work.

Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner.

But I'm proud of you that you did it.

Hey thanks, chief!

Now get the [BLEEP] out of here!

Pretty cool, huh, Morty? Oh.

Uh, I thought it was cool.

I don't give a fuck what you think, Jerry.

Hey, uh... Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay?

I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer.

No, you don't. You're the little brother.

You're not the cause of your parents' misery.

You're just a symptom of it.

Can I show you something?

Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident.

That, out there? That's my grave.

Wait, what?

On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world.

So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one.

Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed.

And in this one, we were dead.

So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place.

And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast, 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse.

So, you're not my brother?

I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don't run".

Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere... everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV.

Mrs. Sullivan always planned to leave everything to her cats.

But sometimes, plans need a helping paw.

What are the kitties to do, but buckle together and work as a team.

Mrs. Sullivan, I, uh... please forgive me for being forward.

But your eyes are so beautiful!

Wait, this is an actual movie?

This fall... sparks will fly!

Mrs... Oh... Sullivan...

Between one guy, who can't get a break...

There's something about you, Mrs. Sullivan.

...and 9 cats who break all the rules.

Last Will and Testa-meow: Weekend at dead Cat Lady's House 2.

Well, somebody in Hollywood just lost their job.

Written and directed by Jerry Smith.

I wrote and directed that? What am I, nuts?

Hey Morty, you just missed a preview for your Dad's "Citizen Kane".

Doesn't matter.

Hey, if your, uh, mother and I had to split custody... who would you guys choose?

Doesn't matter.

Breaking News: Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit after suffering an apparent breakdown.

Don't even think about it.

Come on, Jer-

Are you kidding me, Jerry?

It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap.

It's my life, and we're watching it.

You did it, Beth. You really nailed it.

You're a surgeon. A human surgeon.

Yay... you win.

Where the hell am I going?

What are you asking me for Jerry?

I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out.

They got a clear shot to your head.

I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this.

Jerry? Jerry Smith?

Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school.

I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart.

I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I never stopped thinking about what might've been.

Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers?

Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers.

Yeah, Ball Fondlers.

Ha-ha, Hamster-in-Butt-World Weather is done, and now it's sports time, coming up.

Oh, hello there!

Good day to you, Miss.

So the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people?

Yeah, sweetie, that's where they live.

Well, how does that work?

I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?

Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and walk around on their own?

Look, I don't know! I'm watching the same thing you guys are.

Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off...

How would they find their butt person again?

I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV!

All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day.

Ooh! Family vacation!

Hey, Rick. I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend.

You think you could help me out?

Whatever.

Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father-son thing.

Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.

Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.

Uh...

Yeah, dad. Why don't we do it together?

Yes!

You backed the right horse on this one, son.

We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee, and knock this thing out in two or three days.

What is my purpose?

Pass the butter.

Thank you.

Dad, I need a ride to work.

Maybe Rick can give you a ride.

I'm helping Morty with science.

I'm busy.

Doing what?

Uh, anything else.

What is my purpose?

You pass butter.

Oh, my god.

Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

Since when do you have a job?

Since last week.

It's part-time at this little vintage thrift store.

My boss is this really smart, eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.

Meow.

Can't wait to meet this fascinating character.

Please don't.

Oh.

Well, when did this stop being Jamba Juice?

I've just recently opened for business, mister, um, Goldenfold.

You know my name? That's disarming.

I also know you long for female company.

You know, it has been lonely since the divorce.

Some voids can't be filled with Jamba Juice.

This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women.

Free of charge.

One never pays here-- not with money.

Nothing to read into there.

Thanks!

Sorry I'm late, mr. Needful.

This is my grandpa, Rick. He was just leaving.

Huh.

Tell me, Rick, what do you desire?

Eh, I make my own stuff.

So, what are you-- like, the devil?

What? Sorry?

I don't know.

Store comes out of nowhere, all the shit's old and creepy.

Are you the devil? A demon?

Leprechaun?

Grandpa Rick!

Hey, I'm not judging.

Just like to shoot straight. I'm a man of science.

Ah, then perhaps you could make use of this.

This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension.

Grandpa, go home and drink.

Why don't we do a model of the solar system?

That's what my dad did with me when I was your age.

Oh, okay.

You know, Rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science.

A man and his boy, making planets.

Hey, how about we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

And then Jupiter --

Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet.

Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

I learned that in the third grade.

Well, yeah, but you know they changed it.

Morty, nobody changed the planets.

I just googled it.

Pluto's not a planet.

They changed it in 2006.

Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

And I disagree.

You disagree?

That's right.

It's possible to disagree in science, Morty.

Pluto was a planet.

Some committee of fancy assholes disagree.

I disagree back.

Give me a ping-pong ball.

Um, okay.

I-I just have to...

Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto?

No.

Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom.

Damn.

Oh.

Okay, good.

This is gonna be fun.

Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick.

Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?

Um...

Rhetorical question, Morty.

The answer's "yes, you just have to be a genius".

Cute.

Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.

Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick.

I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know?

Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled.

I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.

Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick.

I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing.

Well, that's retarded.

What are you guys talking about?

Apparently, nothing.

You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

No!

It's not.

Shut up, Rick.

Whoa.

I don't care what anyone says.

If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again.

Planet.

Planet, planet, planet.

Stay scientific, Jerry.

This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent!

A price for everything, mr. Goldenfold.

A price for everything.

Oh, my God!

How could I not see this coming?!

My lust!

My greed!

I deserved this!

I deserved this!

This serum should counteract the negative effects.

Holy cats!

Ladies, let's get out of here.

I haven't learned a thing!

Here.

You can have this back.

You didn't use it?

Sure I did -- to develop this.

It detects and catalogs all your "twilight zone", "ray bradbury", "Friday the 13th" the series voodoo crap magic.

I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say...

A typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murder happen in real life?

Ooh.

Be quiet.

Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting?

You're not intentionally selling... beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?

I find this all quite preposterous.

Oh, I say, good sir.

Oh, harrumph.

Oh, oh Oh, oh that's beautiful.

You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours?

Do I need to call the police?

Here, you can use my phone.

Don't worry. It won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack.

You think you're so great, you stupid piece of shit.

Stop! Hey!

Fuck you, man.

Stop it right now!

Grandpa Rick, I like working here.

You work for the devil.

So what?

"So what?"

Yes, so what if he's the devil, Rick?

At least the devil has a job.

At least he's active in the community.

What do you do?

You eat our food and make gadgets.

Buh-bye.

Whoops.

I'm sorry, mr. Needful.

I'll clean that up.

I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but --

It's fine.

Summer, you know, your grandfather's right.

This store curses people.

That's my business.

Well, yeah.

Fast-food gives people diabetes, and clothing stores have sweatshops.

Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil?

This is my first job.

You've been nice to me, mr. Needful.

You respect me.

Please, call me "the devil".

I'd rather not, actually.

Yes, perhaps not during business hours.

I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet.

Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first.

I think I know what the "a" in NASA stands for.

Dad, what's your endgame?

Ain't no game, sucka.

Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets?

It's even easier.

Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round?

Science isn't always easy, Morty.

Whoa!

Whoa!

What the hell?!

I'm king Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto.

We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world.

You really gave it to those guys at NASA.

I was -- you know, sometimes science is about conviction.

I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.

Oh, I...

Plutonians.

Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system.

Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision.

Um... Pluto's a planet.

Pluto's a fucking planet, bitch!

Oh, man.

This is definitely gonna go to his head.

If it's athletic prowess you desire, principle vagina, I might --

I'll take it.

But I haven't even --

Thank you very, very much. Great store. Great place. Bye.

Huh. Okay.

I must say, summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since salem.

Nice.

"Wholesome delight" for lunch?

Is that the vegan place?

Yeah, I love their soup.

I'm kind of soup-ed out.

Mrs. Tate, is it?

What do you desire?

Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

Oh, is there a limit?

Everything's free, right?

Let's just say you don't pay... with money.

That was perfect.

You pay with the curses, right?

Um... I -- well...

But, mrs. Tate, why do you want cursed items?

Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at "Curse Purge Plus".

You know, the guy on TV?

What?

Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep] with you in unforeseeable ways?

Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus".

I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers.

This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what?

He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless.

I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million.

See you at the olympics.

This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family.

Now it does their taxes.

Everything's deductible.

Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul.

Pay for it with money.

You know, like how every other store in the world works?

We're located at First and Main in old town.

Come on -- come on down.

"First and..."

That's right across the street from "Needful Things," where you can get evil items for free!

Diabolic son of a motherfucking-

We're back on "Good morning, Pluto."

And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry?

Pluto is a planet.

Well, how about that.

I love it.
Morty Smith.

I'm Scroopy Noopers.

I'm a scientist.

Can I show you something?

Uh, I better not.

Right now.

The center of Pluto, mr. Smith, is made of a substance called "Plutonium".

Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers.

And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.

There it goes again. Just shrank a little.

But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a "planet" anymore.

Should've been our wake-up call.

But the rich Plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally...

Um, a party?

Is everyone in your family an idiot?

Well, for sure me and my dad are.

Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.

Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure.

Hmm. Funny.

Mr. Needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

I wish this desk was lighter.

I wish this knot was looser.

Come on.

I don't --

Wait, what am I doing?

I wish I knew CPR.

1, 2, 3.

Oh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw.

Mr. Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible?

I'm the devil.

What should I do when I fail -- get myself an ice cream?

You haven't failed.

People like Rick are making me obsolete.

I mean, seriously.

I may be "the devil", but your grandpa is the devil.

I just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny.

No! It's not fair.

Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you -- even Rick.

I was your only friend, and I get nothing?

Okay. I'll give you one thing.

Name it.

I want to help you.

Clever twist.

I learned from the best, you old fart.

Now, let's go get you hydrated.

Looks like we've got... haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity.

I can take out the "eternity" and the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens.

Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.

How's business?

Here's the last of our inventory.

We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.

Sounds like code for "you win, Rick."

That was important to you, wasn't it?

Nope.

It was important to your dumb devil friend.

To me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny fucked with the opera singer for 20 minutes.

He tried to kill himself.

Seriously?

Holy crap.

Holy crap.

But you know what, grandpa Rick?

He's strong, and he's never going to give up.

Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.

Oh, I know.

Everyone knows you don't care.

So?

So have fun not caring.

I always do.

Good.

Yeah, it is good. It's the best.

I'm sure it is.

Bye.

Later.

I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.

Yeah, uh... Give me a sec.

These are the forms for the employee health plan.

All right, yeah, put -- put them on my... Eh.

I just got bored. Everybody out.

All right, just one more rally, then I promise we'll get back to your science project.

Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

It's shrinking because of corporations.

Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser.

Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong?

You said science wasn't easy.

I said science isn't always easy.

Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy.

Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son.

Dad, their whole planet is dying.

Ha!

You called it a planet.

Checkmate.

What's up, Pluto?

Mr. Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me.

Go on.

My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is Pluto.

My god, the man's a genius.

Um, excuse me.

Morty, what?

Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deep-core Plutonium drilling?

Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?

I mean, I'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there.

Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?

Good one, dad.

Hey, Morty, you want to go on a... Oh.

Hey, Beth. Hello?

Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid?

Thanks.

Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie.

I am not programmed for friendship.

Suit yourself.

Hey. Hey.

W-w-what's going on?

Um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project?

Whatever.

Jerry, you must be so excited.

The Pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive.

I'm flattered and humbled.

Oh, I like that.

Use that in your speech.

Also, talk about Pluto being a planet.

People like that.

Your highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers.

You animals! Animals!

Ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end.

Take him to Pluto-namo bay.

You can't kill the truth, father.

What?

I can see you're confused.

Pluto-namo bay is a military prison-- a sort of play on words.

Did he call you "father"?

Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son?

The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry.

Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.

It's a what?

Huh? Oh, planet.

"Pluto is a cold, cold planet".

That's what I meant.

Knock them dead out there, you.

Pluto is... Not a planet.

Ow!

It's not a planet.

Hey!

It's not a planet!

I'm an idiot, and I love my son.

It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled "Needful Things" into the globally-compliant web 4.0, "e-nomenon", "n33dful.com", spelled with threes instead of "e"'s.

Whoo, yeah!

Whoo, excited!

Okay, that's it.

We just got bought by Google!

Mm.

I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

So, how much did we make?

"We".

This is my business.

Security!

You're Zuckerberg-ing me?

I was Zuckerberg-ing people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.

I'm the devil, bitch!

What, what?!

Hey!

Hey!

Hey, Morty.

Oh, oh, hey, dad.

Um, what -- what are you doing back from Pluto so quick?

Uh... Some people just can't handle the truth.

Especially dummies like me.

Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.

Hey, dad.

Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad.

You're a genius at that.

Wow.

That's... humbling and flattering, son.

Thank you.

What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system?

Um... I'm just gonna take this thing in and get an "A".

Butter.

But...

You're a genius at being my dad, dad.

Quit while you're ahead.

And also, knock next time, you know?

I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14 --

I got a computer in here, you know?

Oh, I -- I think I understand.

You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.

I get it. Say no more.

I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something.

I got it!

Noted. Good night.

How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka "the devil"?

He dumped me.

Oof. Sorry.

Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing?

Not sure.

Maybe in a much bigger way, mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted?

Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval?

No, that's dumb.

Yeah, not satisfying.

I'll tell you what, though.

If -- if -- if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh, totally. Let's do it.

And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the up front.

Thank you, Seattle.

Rick? Summer?

Stupid motherfucker.

You stupid bitch.

How do you like that?

W-w-why?

Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.

We did it.

Yeah, bro.

We totally worked it.

Yeah.

We just pulled it off.

Yeah, bro. Yeah.

So, dad, guess what tomorrow is.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

No.

Well, it... might be.

It is.

Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives.

I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth.

Regular pancakes are fine.

Oh, my God!

Oh, what is happening?!

Happy anniversary, dad.

Oh, I get it.

Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.

I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.

You should be making us a whole restaurant.

Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around.

I just wish I got to see more of you.

Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C-137, you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks.

Hey! What the heck?!

Neutralize the Jerry.

Wait! No! I'll --

Dad!

Dad!

Rick!

Everybody, relax.

If I know these a-holes, and I am these assholes, they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions.

Let's get it over with.

Bring his Morty.

Oh, man.

Leave my Morty out of this.

You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-- join the council.

W-w-w-what about Jerry?

Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

...Give you anything!

I have a rare antique-coin collection!

Just don't hurt me!

Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting.

They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington.

Our son's been abducted!

You hate me for buying those coins!

Geez, Rick, w-what is this place?

The citadel of Ricks.

It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.

Council of Ricks?

As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat -- galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government.

Wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa, and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem, so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo! Answers.

Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me.

Geez, you're easy to impress.

Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty.

This place is a real who's who of who's you and me.

Turn your boring, old Morty into a-- hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers.

Hey, check this out.

Show me the Morty.

Dumb.

Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured?

You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured --

Back off!

Not my cup of tea, this place.

I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick.

Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

Fuck me, pal.

Fuck you?

No, no, no, no, no. Fuck me.

Bring up the holograms.

27 Ricks brutally murder in their own timelines-- an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic.

What say you, earth Rick C-137?

You think I did this?

Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?

You have a history of non-cooperation with the council.

Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick.

W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs?

Because he's dead, too!

Who else would you have us question?

You fit the profile.

Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent, the rogue.

I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.

You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government.

That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them.

They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste, and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top, and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence!

So, as they say in Canada, peace oot!

Evidence! Good idea.

Scan his portal gun!

Oh, come on.

Don't look at another man's portal-gun history.

We -- we all go to weird places.

Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murder occurred.

What?! That's Rick-diculous!

I'm obviously being set up.

Earth Rick C-137, the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp.

Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls.

I've heard enough.

Run, Morty!

Unh-unh. Not you.

Aaaah!

No!

Oh! Oh!

Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please.

White people. No, no, no, no. Black people.

And hispanic on half.

Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please.

High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner.

And wheelchair on half.

They could have gone into any one of these.

Son of a...

Oh, geez.

Oh, man!

We lost 'em.

Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please.

Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary.

And pay phone on half.

That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

Those guys were wrong, right?

Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill yourself -- yourselves.

Of course not, Morty. How could that profit me?

But someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names -- by finding the real Rick-killer.

I'm scared, Rick.

Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons, like that show "doomsday preppers".

Not really my style, Morty.

Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now.

All right, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location.

You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer.

Who wants lemonade?

Oh, yeah.

Mmm! Oh! Delicious!

Beth you're a treasure.

I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what?

She's not as brilliant or attractive.

Aw. Thank you.

Oh! She did! She did it!

H-hello?

Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

Rick! Hey.

What's -- what's up?

So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn, so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole.

What?!

Is that cool with you, dawg?

Rick, no!

Morty!!

We got it.

The call's coming from...

Look at his face! You dummy!

Can't believe our daughter married you.

Too easy!

The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry.

They won't be able to help themselves.

But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us.

Phones à la clams and phonesghetti with phone bills.

Anything else?

Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

Right away, sir.

You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond".

But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.

Yeah, it's got to be that way.

You're a camouflage.

Camouflage?

What are you talking about, Rick?

Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius.

The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible.

See, when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh... Morty waves.

Um... Because o-our personalities are so different?

Oh, shit, dawg.

My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty-- obviously by the real killer, to frame me.

But I was able to trace the signal.

Come on. Let's go.

Uh-oh.

Excuse me.

We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location.

They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us each with a red "X" right now.

That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying.

Hey, check it out.

Damn it!

Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

The red "X"! Red "X"!

Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty?

Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time.

You don't have to keep saying it over and over.

Man, this place is way off the grid.

This guy does not want to be found.

Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide?

I mean, isn't that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices?

Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.

Oh, my God, Rick, look!

There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!

Not people, Morty -- Mortys.

Oh, God!

W-w-why would somebody do this? It's horrible!

Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats, but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain, that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks.

I fiddled with a concept like this once.

On paper, Morty. On paper.

I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill.

I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like, five Mortys and a jumper cable.

Which I also wouldn't do!

I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.

Coffee time!

Yeah!

Yo, yo, yo, yo!

That's what I like to hear!

Hi, Jerry.

Leave me alone. I'm working.

Oh, you are? W-w-w-what do you do?

I-I'm -- I'm in between advertising jobs.

Advertising? Wow!

So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then y-y-you help 'em?

Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy who really has it all together.

Dude, are you -- w-- you're being a dick, right?

Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't want to offend you in any way.

You're really a Rick?

Y-- of course I am -- just as much as my Morty's a Morty.

Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "mask."

You know, the one with Cher in it?

That's right, Jerry!

He -- he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask" people.

He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own.

But if I did, boy, I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.

Hey, get a load of this.

Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick.

This is perfect.

I'm not doofus Rick!

I'm Rick!

Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop?

Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?

Hey, I don't eat poop!

Y-you guys are always so mean to me.

I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry.

I'm the worst Rick of them all.

According to who -- other versions of you?

If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you got to stop listening to yourself.

Wow. You really are wise, Jerry.

I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising.

The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.

You don't care about me at all!

I'm no different than that jacket you've got on!

Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal gun!

I'm just a tool!

I-I-I'm just an object!

Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty.

Now, for the love of God, be quiet.

The point of this is to get the drop on the guy.

You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something!

I'm more than a human shield!

Yeah, that's right.

You are.

You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty, because you're as dumb as I am smart, which is why when I say "shut up," it's really good advice.

Great. Nice work, Morty.

Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

You -- aren't you a tough customer.

The slow clap? Really?

Kind of played out, dude.

Not in this dimension, it isn't.

In fact I invented it.

Nobody else has ever even done it here before.

Well, la-di-da.

Hey, that's mine!

I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty.

We got to escape.

I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

Y-you're a monster.

Don't be ridiculous, Morty.

Will you -- will you stop saying that?

It's stupid.

Take his Morty away.

Come with me.

Yeah, gladly.

Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works.

Is there any way we could shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside?

It would be pointless.

Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.

In here.

Ah. Isn't it beautiful?

Yeah, yeah.

Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here.

Zing!

That guy got it.

Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

You're missing my symphony.

Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons.

Zip!

This guy is on it!

He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick.

That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds.

You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are.

I wanted you to find me.

We're not so different, you and I.

Yeah, duh!

See this right here, Rick?

I crunched the numbers.

I created a spectrum of all the Ricks.

I listed them out from most evil to least evil.

Here's where I am.

And look it -- right here's where you are, Rick.

This guy right here -- super-weird.

I get it.

So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right?

Is that where you're going with this?

'Cause that's where I'd be going.

Please.

I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.

I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you.

Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate... Ovenless brownies!

Mmm. Mmm!

It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order.

Well, come on.

I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

It was your idea.

Come here, Jerry!

Hey, uh, come here.

I-I want to show you something.

Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but you're a genius scientist.

What do you think? See?

There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be.

You know, Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their current value.

The truth is, you bought them because you like them.

They have value to you.

That's what matters.

How long are you staying?

Until we find your Rick.

I found mine.

Help!

There is no escape, my son.

We will find our peace in the next world.

So, what -- you're just gonna give up?

We're giving in -- to the power of the one true Morty.

One day, he will return.

Praise the one true Morty.

Ugh.

All right, Mortys, listen up.

My name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C-137.

I know you're scared, because I'm scared.

But that's no reason to accept our fate!

We're Mortys!

We're not defined by our relationships to Rick!

Our destiny is our own!

This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.

I'm sick of being a human shield.

I want to be a gardener!

I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!

I'm more than just a hammer!

He is the one true Morty!

Hooray!

The one true Morty!

Hey, keep it down!

You've lived quite a life, Rick.

It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.

You're crying? Over a Morty?

No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

Ugh. Pathetic.

We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.

Do your worst, you little bastards!

kill me! Do it!

Do I-I-I-I-it!

Morty! Thank God!

Get me out of this.

Come on!

You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

Point taken, but this is no time for arcs.

Oh!

Yeah, hello.

Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?

Huh? W-who is this?

I found the real killer, bitch!

Get over here!

Yo, ding-dong, we're done here. Time to go.

Well, Jerry, I guess this means goodbye.

W-w-well, does it have to?

I mean, you -- you look just like Rick.

We could maybe, you know, get rid of him.

I'm not saying kill him, necessarily.

I -- I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but --

Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work.

It's time to go back to our lives.

I love you, Jerry. I love you.

Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

W-what -- w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys?

They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls.

Poor little Rickless bastards.

Earth Rick C-137, the council apologizes for its false accusation, and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should --

Uh, guys, not a good time.

Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device.

Saved your ass.

All right, Morty.

Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.

Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

That right there, that w-- that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, you know?

To connect with me a little.

Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club, like all those dumb Ricks.

You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the rickest Rick there is.

And, you know, it would g-- Go without saying that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty.

It would go without saying, huh?

Yeah, it would.

Did you hear me say it?

Nah.

The Mortyest Morty.

Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster brown.

A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems.

It can be a real bad thing for everybody.

Oh, yeah? How's that?

U-uh, I'll explain when you're older.

What a mess.

Pride comes before the fall.

I guess he got what he deserved.

What is that?

Hand me the laser difibulator.

Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

No! Go clean the toilets.

Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.

You make us ashamed to be ourselves!

My God. I've seen this technology before.

This Rick was being controlled remotely -- puppeteered by somebody else.

This is the receiver.

Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

Wubba lubba dub dub!

Oh. Hey, Jerry.

What are you doing in my room, buddy?

Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.

All right.

Okay, get out.

What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him?

You know he eats his own shit, right?

Oh, my God, this is rich!

I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.

Bye, mom! Bye, dad!

Drive carefully!

Have fun, you two.

Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our...

Titanic -themed getaway.

Let's lose the attitude, please.

It's supposed to be romantic.

Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here.

I know, c-can we wrap this up?

Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage.

Hey, don't blow me off.

I am drawing a line, okay?

Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty.

Aw, geez, Rick.

If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.

That's right.

Wait. What?

Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine.

And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever.

It's like that old song "blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop".

You guys know that song?

From tiny rogerts?

You never heard of it?

You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?

No-nobody?

A-all right, whatever.

Look, who cares?

Just go on your stupid trip.

Not one thing out of place.

Not a single thing.

Well, we're past the point of no return.

I'm going to have a party.

I found jello.
Can you sneak your mom's vodka?

Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

Listen, you can't both be in denial about it.

Okay, bye.

Summer, you can't throw a party!

Remember what mom said?

Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished.

I'm only a human being, Morty.

Rick, tell summer she can't have a party!

Uh, summer, you can't have a party.

Because I'm having a party, bitch!

Oh, what?!

Rick, you can't!

What do you mean you're having a party?

Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?

"Glip glop?"

You're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that.

Is that like their n-word?

It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.

Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- screw that.

This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.

That's why you party?

Boy, you really are 17.

Why do you party?

To get wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!

Just keep your Sci-Fi friends away from my awesome ones.

Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes.

After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.

A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive.

Are you sure the ship will sink?

I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before.

It is un-unsinkable.

Ooh!

Look, it's the line for the bow!

Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read.

Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?

Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit.

That's Jack and fabrizio.

This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever.

I can be the only one to do it alone.

Well, what about her?

Excuse me, ma'am.

Would you like to take my place in line?

I, uh -- I could get into trouble.

We won't tell.

So...

You're a Titanic fanatic?

Oh, yes.

I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate.

Happy to help... rose.

I love watching bukkake.

I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it...

Brad! Hey!

Yo.

Brad is here!

Quick, make my hair look drunk.

Check it out.

Tammy's already drunk.

Cool.

The beacon was activated.

Who is in danger?

Ugh! Grandpa!

Birdperson!

I am pleased there is no emergency.

Oh, there's an emergency, all right.

A emergency!

When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?

It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.

Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playa.

Go have some fun out there birdperson.

Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?

Uh... people?

Mm, six.

Yo! What up, my glip glops?!

Oh, man!

Oh!

Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?

Hey, uh, what the hell?!

Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party.

Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting!

You guys are in my parents' bed!

Oh. Sorry.

I'm not feeling too well.

I just needed to lie down for a bit.

Oh. Okay.

S-s-sorry.

Oh, my God!

Are you kidding me?!

The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

No, no, to-totally.

Rick, you got to stop --

Morty!

Have you met Gearhead?

Hey, how's --

Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars.

How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?

Uh... Not at all.

Oh, boy.

I envy you.

Okay, it was about 754 years ago...

Oh, hey, Morty!

H-have you -- have you met my buddy Scropon?

Not again, Rick.

That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know?

And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!

Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.

Have a little perspective.

Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!

Aw! Squanchy!

Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?

Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man.

All right!

I like your squanch!

Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"?

Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax.

Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!

Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out.

Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?

Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick.

You know, you like not caring about stuff.

You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?

For me?

Jessica.

Knock it off, slow mobius!

Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!

I can't believe she's here.

Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty?

Go. Talk to her.

Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.

Oh, Rose.

Whee!

Is that what I think it is?

Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.

It's so romantic.

I can't wait to do that with Beth.

I don't know, Jerry.

With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.

Look!

Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

Uh, sir?

There's not a problem.

What do you mean there's not a problem?

The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course.

This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!

Well, do something!

Steer into it!

I'm trying!

It's too late.

Ladies and gentlemen...

Don't brace yourselves.

No! No!

What happened?!

Their rail system must have failed.

Oh, my God!

We're not gonna sink!

Totally gonna get laid tonight.

I like your feathers.

They are designed to attract the attention of the female.

It's working.

Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.

I'm not looking to get into a soul bond.

I'm just looking for...

I believe birdperson can arrange that.

Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.

Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her.

Are you kidding me?

I don't even know what she's doing here.

Whoa. Not cool, summer.

This is a party.
Everybody should be welcome.

Oh, great.

Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?

I thought everyone was welcome.

It's not the same, Summer.

Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf hitler and Abraham Lincoln.

Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.

Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being.

But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body!

Whoa. What's up, man?

I have no quarrel with you, boy.

"Boy"?

What's that supposed to mean?

It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but...

Don't look at me, dude.

Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --

So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!

Well, no, but...

You know?

What do I know?

That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?

Leave him alone, Brad.

Stay out of this, Jessica!

Kick his ass, Brad!

Kick his ass!

Kick his ass!

Kick his ass!

Brad!

Rick!

I just did you a favor, Morty.

Sorry about all that.

Rick has some really strange friends.

Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

He's always trying to prove what a man he is.

I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.

Jessica, can I show you something?

Wow! Look at all this stuff.

Yeah.

This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop.

Check this out.

It's beautiful.

You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.

What's that, Morty?

I think that you're the most --

No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there.

Oh, my God!

Aah!

Hey, I'm squanching in here!

Oh, my God!

Oh, that is so disgusting!

Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

Huh.
Big star in the sky.

Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Giant testicle monsters.

We'll be fine! Let's party!

I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.

Oh, man.

You hear that, Morty?

You really lucked out with Summer on that one.

How are you guys not freaking out right now?!

The whole house is sitting in another dimension!

I mean, what the hell are we supposed to do?!

Mom and dad are gonna kill us!

I'm losing it here, Rick!

Relax, Morty, relax!

It's gonna be fine.

All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals.

Oh, shit, motherfucker!

Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.

Okay. Let's go, then.

W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you.

I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know?

I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?

Yeah. Me too.

I should stay.

You guys have any aspirin?
Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect!

You can take Lincoler with you.

Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere.

I'm injured.

Shut up, Lincoler.

It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.

Yeah!

And, Nancy, you should go, too.

What? Why -- why me?

Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute.

Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

We should resume sinking shortly.

In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings.

Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken.

I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book.

You should find that Lucy woman.

But -- but --

You see, Jerry?

May I show you something?

Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.

I would have liked to see it.

This trip has been a "Titanic" failure.

Get it?

Ooh!

Draw me, Jerry.

Oh, boy.

Lucy, wow.

Uh, this isn't what I had in mind.

But it's the perfect moment.

We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.

Um, not like this.

Not -- not with you.

You are gonna draw me.

Aah!

Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there.

It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal.

But, at the same time --

Okay!

Um, the crystals should be really close.

There they are!

Wait. Something's not right.

Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!

Summer's gonna like me again.

Lincoler, come on!

Let's get out of here!

Mein journey is over, Morty.

I have something important to tell you.

Rick, I got them!

I got the crystals!

All right!

You did it, Morty.

Rick, wait!

There's something you need to know.

I couldn't have done it without Lincoler.

He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.

He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.

He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick.

He died.

Well, at least he didn't die in vain.

He got these crystals.

And these babies just saved this lame-ass party!

Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

Play something.
Somebody, play something.

Wait a minute. What?

Slow mobius, hit me with the clock beam!

That's the Rick dance!

All right!

Whoa, man!

What the hell was that?!

I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!

What? No, no, no.

I can get us home whenever I want to.

But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them?

I'm starting to come down, Morty.

Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high.

That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!

Oh, Morty, you idiot!

Does anybody else have any more?

Birdperson?

Uh, squanchy?

Don't squaunch at me.

All right, everybody, party is officially over!

Rick, take us home now.

All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill!

Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

Boo! You suck, whatever your name is.

Boo!

Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

But these gears just started turning.

Almost finished, Jerry?

Uh, almost.

I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.

I'm sure it's good enough.

Move!

Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up.

The floor drops out to make it easier.

But now it's my turn.

We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me.

No mess. No clean.

Beth!

Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.

I can't help but feel a little guilty.

I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth?

Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips?

What?

Well, at least you got all this free stuff.

Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.

I'm not going to fit.

Beth, listen to me.

You're going to get out of here.

You're gonna go on, and --

Jerry, just leave the door.

It's not a door, Beth.

It's debris.

I don't care.

Just leave it.

Yeah. Okay.

"Cape fear"!
"Cape fear"!

I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from "cape fear".

Hey, squanchers!

The party's squanching on at my place!

Cool.
I'm coming, too.

Uh, no.

You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.

What?

Nancy told us what a bitch you are.

Guys, seriously.

Nancy?

Summer, you're a bad person.

All you care about is having popular people like you.

That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for.

Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.

You're so wise.

May I assist you with that?

Uh, sure, yeah.

Thanks.

Morty, do you know what "wubba lubba dub dub" means?

Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.

It's not nonsense at all.

In my people's tongue, it means, "I am in great pain.
Please help me."

Well, I got news for you.

He's saying it ironically.

No, Morty.

Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain.

That is why he must numb himself.

Come on, um...

Birdperson.

Come on, birdperson.

Rick's not that complicated.

He's just a huge asshole.

Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together?

It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.

You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.

I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.

My people have another saying.

It means, "whatever lets you sleep at night".

Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.

This is your moment, Morty.

Choose wisely.

Tammy!

Caw!

Wow.
We are so screwed.

Rick, wake up.

Huh? What? Wait? What?

What? Stop.

Rick, you got to do something quick.

My parents are home.

Uh, all -- all right.

All right. Hold -- hold on.

Ahh! So good.

Oh, my God.
They're walking up the driveway.

Bring me the thing.

What -- what thing?

The thing. The thing.

The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it.

It -- it -- it beeps.

Rick!

That describes everything in your garage!

Do you mean this?

Summer for the win.

All right, that should do it.

Whoa!
What did you do?

Uh, see for yourself.

Whoa!

Yeah, everything's frozen in time.

Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that.

For how long?

I don't know.

How long do you guys want?
A week? A month?

Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?

Worst movie ever.

Dumb.

Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.

Get it?

You know, 'cause it's frozen.

This has been so much fun.

Hey, Rick.

You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say.

Don't need to.

I have a new catchphrase.

Oh, yeah?

What -- what's that, Rick?

I love my grandkids.

Aww.

Psych!

Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, "I don't give a fuck".

Roll credits!

Roll the credits! Go!

That's the end, motherfucker!

"I don't give a fuck" is my new catchphrase!

Fuck you!

That's season one! Boom!

Season one up in your face, motherfucker!

Yeah!

Revenge.
What?!

Party!
Whoo, baby!

Please, stop!

Hey, brah!

I don't understand.

Are you enjoying this?

Do you like this?

Yeah, you know it, dawg!

Whoo, baby!
