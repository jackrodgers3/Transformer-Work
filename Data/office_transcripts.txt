Michael: All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?

Jim: Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...

Michael: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?

Jim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.

Michael: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
Michael: [on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.
Michael: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?

Pam: Well. I don't know.

Michael: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]

Pam: What?

Michael: Any messages?

Pam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax.

Michael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.

Pam: You haven't told me.

Michael: It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
Michael: People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Dwight: [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
Jim: My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
Michael: Whassup!

Jim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years.

Michael: Whassup!

Dwight: Whassup!

Michael: Whass...up!

Dwight: Whassup.

Michael: [Strains, grunts] What?

Jim: Nothing.

Michael: OK. All right. See you later.

Jim: All right. Take care.

Michael: Back to work.
Jan: [on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great.
Michael: Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
Jan: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?

Michael: Um... Me no get an agenda.

Jan: What? I'm sorry?

Michael: I didn't get any agenda.

Jan: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.

Michael: Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?

Pam: Uh, yeah, the one...

Michael: Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?

Pam: You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.

Michael: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.

Jan: Do you want to look at mine?

Michael: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.

Jan: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.

Michael: OK...

Jan: Michael, don't panic.

Michael: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.

Jan: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.

Michael: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!

Jan: I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.

Michael: OK. No problem.

Jan: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.

Michael: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a b*tch. It is a real b*tch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Michael: Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?

Jan: Go ahead.

Michel: Packman.

Todd Packer: Hey, you big queen.

Michael: Oh, that's not appropriate.

Todd Packer: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?

Michael: Uh, I don't know what you mean.

Todd Packer: I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?

Michael: Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.

Jan: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.

Michael: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.
Phyllis: So what does downsizing actually mean?

Stanley: Well...
Oscar: You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
Angela: I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.

Kevin: Yeah, it'll be you.
Pam: I have an important question for you.

Jim: Yes?

Pam: Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?

Jim: Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
Michael: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
Michael: Hey.

Ryan: Hey.

Pam: This is Mr. Scott.

Michael: Guilty! Guilty as charged!

Ryan: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.

Michael: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.

Ryan: Yup.

Michael: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm h*tler. Adolf h*tler. [Continues with cod German]
Pam: I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.

Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Jim: Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?

Dwight: What?

Jim: What are you doing?

Dwight: Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.

Jim: It's not on your desk.

Dwight: It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.

Dwight: You can't do that.

Jim: Why not?

Dwight: Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.

Jim: [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.

Dwight: Downsizing?
Dwight: Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Pam: You just still have these messages from yesterday.

Michael: Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]

Pam: What?

Michael: Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.

Pam: Don't we all?

Michael: I'm sorry?

Pam: Nothing.

Michael: If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]
Michael: I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
Michael: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
Michael: Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.

Dwight: I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.

Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager.

Dwight: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?

Michael: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.

Oscar: Can't you just tell us.

Dwight: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?

Michael: You don't know what it is. [Laughs]

Dwight: OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.

Michael: I don't need your permission.

Dwight: Go ahead.

Michael: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
Ryan: I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
Oscar: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?

Michael: Not gonna happen.

Stanley: It could be out of your hands Michael.

Michael: It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.

Stanley: Can you promise that?

Dwight: On his mother's grave.

Michael: No.

Phyllis: What?

Michael: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

Stanley: It's just that we need to know.

Michael: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.

Pam: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

Man: Are you sure about that?

Michael: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.

Dwight: Pam, information is power.

Stanley: You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?

Michael: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
Jim: If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
Pam: Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]
Michael: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.

Ryan: What's up? Nice to meet you.

Michael: Introduce yourself. Be polite.

Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.

Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.

Dwight: Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.

Michael: That's his profit.

Dwight: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Dwight: Damn it! Jim!

Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?

Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again.

Pam: [Laughing]

Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
Dwight: It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
Michael: What is that?

Dwight: That is my stapler.

Michael: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.

Dwight: OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?

Jim: How do you know it was me?

Dwight: It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?

Michael: Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.

Dwight: Yeah.

Michael: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.

Jim: OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.

Michael: [Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.

Ryan: You should've put him in custardy.

Michael: Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.

Dwight: OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.

Michael: Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
Jim: Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.

Pam: So when are we going out?

Jim: Tonight, hopefully.

Pam: OK. Yeah.

Roy: Hey, man.

Jim: What's going on?

Roy: Hey, baby.

Pam: Hey.
Pam: Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
Pam: Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?

Roy: No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.

Pam: OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.

Jim: You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.

Roy: It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.

Jim: Yeah, yeah.

Jim: Um... What's in the bag?

Roy: Just tell her I'll talk to her later.

Jim: No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Jim: Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]
Michael: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?

Ryan: Yeah.

Michael: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?

Ryan: All right.

Michael: Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...

Pam: You got a fax.

Michael: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.

Pam: What? Why?

Michael: Why? Well, theft and stealing.

Pam: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?

Michael: Post-it Notes.

Pam: Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?

Michael: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.

Pam: Are you serious?

Michael: Yeah. I am.

Pam: I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're f*ring me.

Michael: But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.

Michael: [Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.

Pam: You're a jerk.

Michael: I don't know about that.
Michael: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
Pam: Hey.

Jim: Hey.

Jim: How are things?

Pam: Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...

Jim: Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?

Pam: It's better, thanks.

Jim: Good. Good.

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: That's great

Pam: Is...?

Jim: Yeah?

Pam: Um... Are you...

Jim: Am I walking out?

Pam: Yes.

Jim: Yes, I... Do you want to...

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Great. Let me just...

Jim: [Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.

Pam: Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.

Jim: Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.

Michael: Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?

Mr. Brown: Oh, I'm all set, thanks.

Michael: Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
Michael: Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of b*at me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
Jim: That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.

Jim: Do you really have to do that right now?

Dwight: Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.

Jim: Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.

Dwight: Retaliation. Tit for tit.

Jim: That is not the expression.

Dwight: Well, it should be.
Jim: This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
Jim: Solitaire?

Pam: Yeah, Freecell.

Jim: Six on seven.

Pam: I know. I saw that.

Jim: So then, why didn't you do it?

Pam: I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.

Jim: Who doesn't love that?
Michael: Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?

Oscar: All right.

Michael: Did you have a good weekend going there?

Oscar: It was fine.

Michael: Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---

Oscar: Martinez.

Michael: Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!

Mr. Brown: Great. We're all set.

Michael: Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?

Jim: Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.

Michael: It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.

Jim: You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.

Michael: Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!

Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.

Michael: You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.

Mr. Brown: Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.

Michael: Exactly, were not...

Mr. Brown: That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.

Michael: With tolerance.

Mr. Brown: No. With more ignorance.

Michael: Ignorance.

Mr. Brown: Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.

Michael: Let's celebrate.

Mr. Brown: Right. OK.

Michael: Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?

Mr. Brown: Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...

Michael: You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.

Dwight: I have two. White and Indian.

Mr. Brown: Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?

Michael: Yes.

Mr. Brown: Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.

Michael: OK.

Mr. Brown: Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.

Dwight: A few of the ground rules?

Michael: Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.

Dwight: OK, can we steer away from gay people?

Mr. Brown: Um...

Dwight: I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.

Mr. Brown: Well, we only have an hour.

Dwight: I figured it would save time.

Michael: OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...

Mr. Brown: Mr. Brown.

Michael: Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.

Mr. Brown: Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
Michael: How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
Mr. Brown: So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.

Michael: I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.

Mr. Brown: Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.

Michael: OK, I will play guy listening.

Mr. Brown: Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?

Kevin: I remember.

Mr. Brown: Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.

Michael: OK.
Michael: Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
Kevin: Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more r*cist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.

Michael: OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!

Mr. Brown: Wait a second.

Michael: [Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!

Mr. Brown: Stop it!

Michael: [As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?
Mr. Brown: Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.

Dwight: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.

Mr. Brown: Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?

Dwight: A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.

Mr. Brown: OK.

Dwight: A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.

Mr. Brown: Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.

Dwight: We all have a hero in our heart.

Mr. Brown: Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.

Michael: [Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.

Mr. Brown: I can't leave until you do.

Michael: Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?

Mr. Brown: Michael, can I talk to you candidly?

Michael: Sure.
Mr. Brown: We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.

Michael: Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.

Mr. Brown: Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.

Michael: OK, well I know. You told me that several times.

Mr. Brown: Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.

Michael: OK.

Mr. Brown: Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.

Michael: Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.

Mr. Brown: Don't worry about dating.

Michael: I won't.

Mr. Brown: OK. Thank you.

Michael: Yeah, yeah.
Michael: "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.
Jim: Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.

Michael: "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
Michael: All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.

Toby: Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]

Michael: Get out.

Toby: I'm sorry.

Michael: No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
Michael: [on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a r*cist, I will att*ck you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Michael: OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?

Jim: [/b]: Uh, is that it?

Michael: Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.

Kevin: It was kind of hard to hear.

Michael: Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...

Kelly: I have a customer meeting.

Michael: Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.

Oscar: What part Native American?

Michael: Two fifteenths.

Oscar: Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.

Michael: Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.

Oscar: OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.

Michael: Oh, yeah...

Oscar: And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.

Michael: Wow.

Oscar: My parents were Mexican.

Michael: Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?

Oscar: Thank... Yeah...

Michael: Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?

Oscar: Mexican isn't offensive.

Michael: Well, it has certain connotations.

Oscar: Like what?

Michael: Like... I don't... I don't know.

Oscar: What connotations, Michael? You meant something.

Michael: No. Now, remember that honesty...

Oscar: I'm just curious.

Michael: ...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!

Jim: Hello? Hello?
Michael: I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
Michael: Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
Michael: Oh this is a good one.

Pam: Um, hi. How are you?

Stanley: Fine. How are you?

Pam: Great.

Michael: Push it.

Stanley: I admire your culture's success in America.

Pam: Thank you.

Michael: Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. sl*very versus the Holocaust. Come on.

Stanley: Who am I supposed to be?

Michael: No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.

Dwight: Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.

Dwight: Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.

Pam: That's nice, Dwight.

Dwight: OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.

Pam: OK, I like your food.

Dwight: Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!

Michael: Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.

Pam: OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.

Dwight: Oh, man, am I a woman?
Michael: You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too expl*sive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.
Jim: What are you watching?

Ryan: Chappelle's Show.

Jim: Really?

Ryan: I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.

Jim: No way. I think she likes this stuff.

Ryan: Great. She's cute, huh?

Jim: Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...

Ryan: Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.

Jim: Oh, yeah. She's hot.
Kevin: Hey.

Angela: Hey.

Kevin: You wanna go to the beach?

Angela: Sure.

Kevin: You wanna get high?

Angela: No.

Kevin: I think you do, mon.

Angela: Stop...

Michael: OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
Michael: [Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?

Kelly: I just had the longest meeting.

Michael: Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]

Michael: [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
Jim: [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
Michael: I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.

Kevin: [Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.

Michael: Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.

Stanley: It's collard greens.

Michael: What?

Stanley: It's collard greens.

Michael: That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
Jim: [Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.

Pam: [stirs] Mmmm.

Jim: Hey.

Pam: Oh.

Jim: We can go.

Pam: Sorry.

Jim: That's fine.
Jim: Uh... Not a bad day.

Michael: Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.

Pam: I'm not making any copies.

Michael: Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.

Pam: Nothing new.

Michael: Lay them on me. What?

Pam: There's nothing new.

Michael: That's not what you said earlier.

Pam: Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]
Michael: The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
Jan: So, which health plan have you decided on?

Michael: I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.

Jan: Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?

Michael: I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.

Jan: The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.

Michael: Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.

Jan: Michael.

Michael: You gotta cr*ck these things open.

Jan: You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.

Michael: Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.

Jan: It's your job. So...

Michael: Well, it's a su1c1de mission, you know.

Jan: Michael... maybe... I mean...

Michael: There, there...

Jan: Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.

Michael: [scoffs] When have you ever done that?

Jan: I'm doing it right now. To you.
Jim: Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?

Pam: No. I have a life.

Jim: Interesting, what's that like?

Pam: You should try it sometime.

Jim: Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...

Pam: [laughs]... your problem.

Michael: Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
Michael: There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.

Jim: Gosh.

Michael: Yeah!

Jim: That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.

Michael: Really?

Jim: Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
Jim: Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
Dwight: Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Jim: Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
Dwight: OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I f*re?

Michael: Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.

Dwight: OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.

Michael: You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.

Dwight: [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.

Michael: Nope, you cannot use it.

Dwight: OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.

Michael: Temporary workspace. You can use it.

Dwight: Thank you.
Michael: If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
Dwight: What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.

Dwight: In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm d*ad." Well, I'm not d*ad. I'm the lion. You're d*ad.
Stanley: There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

Michael: [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?

Pam: Where are you?

Michael: Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?

Pam: Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...

Michael: Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.

Pam: No you're not.

Michael: I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?

Pam: OK.

Michael: Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.

Pam: Still no one calling.
Pam: Dwight, what...

Dwight: Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.

Jim: It says "workspace".

Dwight: Same thing.

Jim: If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?

Dwight: Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.

Jim: You are not my superior.

Dwight: Oh gee, then why do I have an office?

Jim: I thought it was a workspace?

Pam: OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?

Dwight: Yes. And my decision in final.

Pam: This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.

Dwight: Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.

Jim: You cut more than you had to, didn't you?

Dwight: Sure.

Jim: Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?

Dwight: Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.

Jim: OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.

Dwight: I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.

Pam: Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?

Dwight: So I can lower it.
Oscar: He literally won't come out of his office.

Kevin: He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.

Angela: Kevin! That's inappropriate.
Oscar: Michael, can I talk to you?

Michael: Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?

Meredith: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?

Michael: Ah, what? Which memo?

Pam: Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.

Michael: Is it a good plan?

Dwight: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.

Oscar: It's like a pay decrease.

Pam: Michael, he made huge cuts.

Michael: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?

Dwight: Yeah, you said...

Michael: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?

Dwight: I can handle that.

Michael: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
Oscar: This is not good.

Angela: It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?

Oscar: What was that?

Angela: You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.

Kevin: What are you guys talking about?

Angela: Nothing, Kevin.
Michael: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.
Dwight: OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.

Jim: OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.

Dwight: OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.

Jim: Workspace.
Michael: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.

Pam: Where are you going?

Michael: Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.
Michael: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.

Travel Agent: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?

Michael: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
Jim: Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.

Pam: I'm inventing new diseases.

Jim: Oh, great.

Pam: So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?

Jim: I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.

Pam: Nice.

Jim: Thank you.
Michael: [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.

Man on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.

Michael: Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.

Man on Phone: It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.

Michael: So it's not a free fall?

Man on Phone: It's an industrial coal elevator.

Michael: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
Michael: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
Dwight: Damnit! Damnit Jim!

Dwight: All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.

Jim: What are you talking about?

Dwight: Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.

Jim: OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?

Dwight: Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created k*ller nanorobot infection.

Dwight: You did this, didn't you?

Jim: Absolutely not.

Dwight: Yes you did.

Jim: No I didn't.

Dwight: I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Jim: k*ller nanorobots?

Pam: It's an epidemic.
Dwight: The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] "Count Choculitis"

Jim: Sounds tough.

Dwight: Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?

Jim: Do you?

Dwight: I think you need to confess...

Jim: Mmm hmm.

Dwight: ...the fact...

Jim: Yep.

Dwight: What are you doing? Those are my keys.

Jim: Good luck. [closes door and locks it]

Dwight: Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]

Stanley: [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
Jim: [answering phone] Jim Halpert.

Dwight: Let me out.

Jim: Who is this?

Dwight: Let me out or you're fired.

Jim: No, you can't f*re me.

Dwight: Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.

Jim: OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.

Pam: [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.

Jim: Hey Pam! How are you?

Dwight: Jim! Open the door!

Pam: Good, how are you? Busy?

Jim: I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?

Dwight: Jim!

Pam: Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?

Jim: No, not at all.

Pam: You don't have anything you're doing?

Jim: I have nothing to do.

Dwight: Jim!

Pam: Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.

Dwight: Jim!

Jim: Oh yeah?

Pam: I might go to the mall.

Jim: The mall?

Dwight: Jim!

Pam: I need new shoes.

Jim: Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
Jan: Hello?

Dwight: Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.

Jan: This is Jan.

Dwight: Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to f*re Jim Halpert.

Jan: Who is this?

Dwight: Dwight Schrute.

Jan: From sales?

Dwight: Well...

Jan: Where's Michael Scott?

Dwight: He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.

Jan: Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?

Dwight: That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.

Jan: Really?

Dwight: Yeah.

Jan: OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.

Dwight: Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I f*re Jim?

Jan: No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.

Dwight: Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
Michael: Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.

Ryan: Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...

Michael: Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.

Stanley: Oh, thanks.

Michael: There you go.

Stanley: This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.

Michael: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.

Dwight: Michael. Michael?

Michael: [under his breath] Oh, Christ.
Dwight: I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Dwight: I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.

Stanley: What about confidentiality?

Dwight: You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.

Meredith: Could you mean vag*na? Because if you do, I want that covered.

Dwight: I thought your vag*na was removed during your hysterectomy?

Meredith: A uterus is different from a vag*na. I still have a vag*na.
Dwight: OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?

Kevin: That's a real thing.

Dwight: Yeah, but no one here has it.

Kevin: Someone has it.
Kevin: Do you think we should go ?

Oscar: I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.

Kevin: What is he doing?

Oscar: I don't know.
Oscar: Well?

Michael: Well, what? You could be referring to anything.

Oscar: OK, the health care plan.

Pam: Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.

Michael: Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?

Dwight: I most certainly did not.

Michael: Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.

Angela: What about the surprise?

Michael: Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?

Stanley: We all think you don't have a surprise.

Michael: All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
Michael: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
Michael: [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...
Michael: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
Dwight: Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.

Jan: Are you listening to me Michael?

Michael: Affirmative.

Jan: What did I just say?

Michael: You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said...

Jan: Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.

Michael: Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!

Jan: I'm not going to do that Michael.

Michael: Okay

Jan: We've created an incentive program to increase sales.

Michael: Uh, huh.

Jan: At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.

Michael: Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?

Jan: Uh, yes. Yes you can.

Michael: Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...

Jan: No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.

Michael: I didn't mean me!
Michael: Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.

Dwight: Sex.

Michael: It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.

Dwight: t*rture.

Michael: Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.

Pam: Uh, Michael?

Michael: Pam!

Pam: Hey, there's a...

Michael: Burger with cheese!

Pam: There's a person here...

Michael: And fries!

Pam: There's...

Michael: And shake! What? Go ahead.

Pam: There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.

Michael: No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.

Pam: Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.

Michael: Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.

Pam: Okay.

Michael: [exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
Katy: This one is hand embroidered.

Michael: All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.

Dwight: Cocks in the henhouse.

Michael: Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?

Katy: Katy.

Michael: Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.

[Pam looks embarassed at Michael - Katy looks sympathetically at Pam]

Michael: Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against v*olence in the workplace.

Dwight: So am I.

Michael: Nobody cares what you think.

Dwight: Doesn't matter.

Michael: So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.

Katy: Wow, thanks.

Pam: There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.

Michael: Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
Michael: I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
Michael: This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall] used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.

[Katy unpacks her handbags]

Michael: So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.

Katy: I guess a cup of coffee would be great.

Michael: Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.

Katy: What?

Michael: It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.

Katy: Regular coffee is fine.

Michael: Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb

Katy: No really it is.

Michael: No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the b*at of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?

Katy: Bring it on.

Michael: Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
Kevin: So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?

Pam: No.

Kevin: She's prettier than you though.

Pam: That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.

Kevin: [nods]
Katy: So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
Dwight: The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
Michael: [handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.

Katy: Thank you.

Michael: I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?

Katy: Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...

Michael: Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?

Ryan: I'm installing File Share on all the computers.

Michael: Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
Michael: You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.

Oscar: I'm on the phone.

Michael: Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.

Katy: That was on Sesame Street.

Michael: I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?

Katy: No, I don't believe that.

Michael: I know, it's unbelievable.
Pam: It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with.
Michael: Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.

Katy: Hi

Toby: Hi, nice to meet you.

Michael: Toby, Katy.

Toby: Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara?

Katy: Yeah.

Toby: Yeah, me too.

Katy: Cool. What year were you there?

Toby: Eighty-nine.

Michael: Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?

Toby: Yeah.

Michael: You and your wife, and you have kids.

Toby: A girl.

Michael: Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?

Toby: [looks resigned]

Katy: I should probably get back to my table.

Michael: Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.
Michael: I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
Roy: Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?

Jim: Cute, sure, yeah.

Roy: Why don't you get on that?

Jim: She's not really my type.

Roy: What are you gay?

Jim: Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.

Kevin: What is your type?

Jim: [glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.

Roy: That's disgusting.

Kevin: Stay away from my mom.

Jim: Too late, Kev.

Roy: [Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.

Pam: We're not dating, we're engaged.

Roy: Engaged, yeah.
Jim: Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
Jim: She'd be perfect for you.

Dwight: Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.

Jim: So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.

Dwight: Assistant to the Regional Manager.

Jim: Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.

Dwight: That's true.

Jim: Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.

Dwight: True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.

Jim: It's all gold.
Katy: Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
Jim: Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you h*t a stall you have a perfect fall back.

Dwight: What's that?

Jim: You buy a purse.

Dwight: I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.

Jim: Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?

Dwight: No.

Jim: Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.

Dwight: Like those?

Jim: Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.

Dwight: Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...

Jim: No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
Jim: Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.

Pam: [smiles]

Jim: [mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?

Pam: [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.

Jim: Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.

Pam: Oh!

Jim: Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.

Pam: Oh...

Jim: I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?

Pam: Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.

Jim: [whispering] Here he comes, shhh...

Jim: [gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good.

Pam: [smiles in agreement]

Jim: He did pick a good one.

Pam: You're horrible.
Katy: This one's really good for a hot date.

Pam: Yeah, what's that?

Katy: [laughs]

Pam: I'm engaged. So...

Katy: Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.

Pam: I wished, right?

Michael: Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?

Katy: Good.

Michael: Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?

[Pam sheepishly hands Katy the purse and leaves]

Katy: [whispers] Sorry.

Michael: Busted.

Katy: [to Pam] Come back...

Michael: Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.

Katy: Is that from Starbucks?

Michael: Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.

Katy: Wow. Is that for the office?

Michael: Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!

Katy: I wouldn't think of it.
Michael: Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
Michael: [Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?

Katy: Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.

Michael: Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?

Katy: Oh no, it's um...

Michael: Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.

Katy: No...

Michael: Seriously. No, really.

Katy: No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.

Michael: God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.

Katy: At five?

Michael: I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.

Katy: Okay.

Michael: What?

Katy: Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.

Michael: Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.

Katy: Okay. Cool.

Michael: Excellent.

Katy: Cool.

Michael: Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
Michael: I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..

Dwight: It's actually better this way.

Michael: No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---

Dwight: Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...

Michael: No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.

Dwight: Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.

Michael: But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.

Dwight: What?

Michael: She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.

Dwight: Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?

Michael: Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...

Dwight: Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?

Michael: No. I cannot promise you that.

Dwight: You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?

Michael: Listen, Dwight.

Dwight: Do you love her?

Michael: [laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]
Katy: I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.

Stanley: Hmmm...

Michael: Espresso?

Katy: Oh, thank you.

Michael: You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.

Stanley: Is that from the machine that was in your office?

Michael: Ummm-hmmm...

Stanley: I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.

Michael: Very easy to clean.

[Stanley walks out]

Michael: Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
Michael: Did we get any mail?

Pam: Yeah, I gave it to you.

Michael: Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...

Pam: So, can I..? [points to the door]

Michael: Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
Jim: A futon?

Pam: [nods]

Jim: He's a grown man

Pam: That's what he said.

Jim: That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]

Roy: What's up?

Pam: [not looking at Roy] Hi.

Roy: Are you still mad at me?

Pam: Roy...

Roy: Come on [begins to tickle Pam]

Pam: Cut it out.

Roy: Come on, you mad at me?

Pam: Stop it. [laughing]

Roy: Are you still mad at me now?

Pam: [giggling] Cut it out.

Roy: Are you mad at me now?

Pam: Stop. [giggling]

Roy: Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.

Pam: [breathless] Stop, I can't breathe.

Roy: I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
Pam: Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
Katy: You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?

Angela: I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.

Katy: Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.

Angela: Yeah, uh no.

Dwight: Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?

Katy: I don't think so I'm really busy.

Dwight: It will just take a second.

Katy: I can't.

Dwight: Just for a minute.

Katy: I really can't.

Dwight: Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.

Katy: No.

Dwight: Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?

Katy: Both.

[Dejected, Dwight walks out slowly]

Katy: What colors do you like?

Angela: Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
Michael: Ryan.

Ryan: Yeah.

Michael: Would you like to help me with a special project?

Ryan: I would love to.

Michael: Alright.
Michael: [in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.

Ryan: You don't want to recycle them?

Michael: Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.

Ryan: Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]

Michael: No.

Ryan: What about this bottle of power drink?

Michael: Uh, what flavor?

Ryan: Blue.

Michael: Blue's not a flavor.

Ryan: It says flavor: Blue Blast.

Michael: Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
Jim: Hi.

Katy: Hi.

Jim: I'm Jim, by the way.

Katy: I'm Katy.

Jim: Hi Katy, nice to meet you.

Katy: You sit out there, don't you?

Jim: I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.

Katy: Okay, um...

Jim: Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.

Katy: Okay. [laughs]

Jim: Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...

Katy: Okay.
Michael: What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.

Ryan: No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.

Michael: No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.

Ryan: Well, it's empty.

Michael: Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.

Ryan: Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?

Michael: That's over several months, Ryan.

Ryan: [Under his breath] Still.
Jim: What's up?

Pam: I'm bored.

Jim: Thank you for choosing me.

Pam: No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?

Jim: Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.

Pam: Really?

Jim: Yeah.

Pam: What are you guys going to do?

Jim: Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.

Pam: That's great.

Jim: And stuff... yeah.

Pam: That's cool.

Jim: What are you doing?

Pam: I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.

Jim: Okay.

Pam: 'Cause Roy's got a truck.

Jim: That's cool.

Pam: Uh, huh. Yes.

Jim: That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?

Pam: Great.

Jim: Okay.

Pam: Okay, I'm gonna head back.

Jim: Alright.
Michael: I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.
Michael: Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.

Katy: Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.

Michael: See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.

Jim: Goodnight, Michael.

Michael: Where you going?

Jim: I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?

Michael: With us?

Katy: I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.

Michael: Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.

Jim: I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael]

Michael: Alright, have fun.

Katy: Thanks.

Jim: I got it.

Michael: Don't drink and drive.

Michael: Take it easy.

Jim: Have a good night.

Michael: You too, have a good night.

Katy: You got that?

Jim: Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.

Katy: Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.

Jim: Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?

Katy: Why?

Jim: This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.

Katy: It's a... it's a very nice car.

Jim: You're not going to freak out?
Michael: Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.

Michael: [clears throat] Hey, what's up?

Jim: Hey.

Michael: Any emails today?

Jim: Um... I don't think so.

Michael: No? Um... Check your spam folder.

Jim: Oh! There it is!

Michael: What?

Jim: Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'

Michael: [laughs uncontrollably]

Jim: Well done.

Michael: Kay.

Jim: Topical.
Michael: I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
Dwight: So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]

Michael: That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.

Dwight: Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?

Michael: Um, I...

Dwight: Consider it?

Michael: Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!

Todd Packer: What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!

Michael: Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!

Todd Packer: [makes laser g*n noises]

Michael: Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.

Todd Packer: bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?

Michael: Uh oh.

Todd Packer: Still q*eer?

Michael: Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Michael: Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
Michael: Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.

Todd Packer: Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.

Michael: Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!

Todd Packer: We're talking blonde incompetent.

Michael: Oh, yeah.

Todd Packer: Like 10 words a minute... talking.

Michael: Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.

Todd Packer: They are women, right?

Michael: Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!

Todd Packer: I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo bl*ws the whistle on the whole thing just to be a b*tch.

Michael: Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Jim: Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
Todd Packer: Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?

Michael: Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]

Todd Packer: [to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go.

Michael: Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.

Jim: Except pass that breathalyzer.
Ryan: You a big William Hung fan?

Todd Packer: Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
Kevin's computer: [monkey noises]
Jim: I'm really excited to meet your Mom.

Pam: You are?
Pam: My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
Pam: I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.

Jim: Oh yeah?

Pam: mmhmm.

Jim: Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.

Pam: Oh really?

Jim: Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Michael: Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.

Dwight: Yes!

Michael: Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".

Toby: Michael?

Michael: Yes, Toby?

Toby: Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.

Michael: Um... literally two seconds?
Michael: Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
Toby: The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.

Michael: No, no, Toby. No.

Toby: It's really not a big deal, Michael.

Michael: It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!

Toby: And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...

Michael: What?

Toby: Just to refresh you... .

Michael: NO!

Toby: on our policy.

Michael: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?

Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.

Michael: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
Michael: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.

Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.

Michael: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
Michael: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake.
Michael: Time to bring out the big g*n. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a k*ller joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just k*ller. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?

Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?

Michael: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.

Darryl: Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?

Roy: Boys R Us!

Warehouse Guy: Oh!

Michael: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.

Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.

Michael: Oooh, okay. That was still about me.

Roy: Hey, hey, hey.

Michael: What?

Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.

Michael: I don't feel bad.

Darryl: [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.

Michael: No, I don't.

Roy: You look like you feel bad.

Michael: Okay.

Roy: Little package!

Michael: Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.

Warehouse guy: Little package! Little package!

Michael: Thank you.

Roy: You look good.

Darryl: Hiding from his momma.

Warehouse guys: [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds]
Toby: So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?

Pam: Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.

Kevin: MILF!

Pam: Thanks, Kevin.
Pam: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.

Toby: Great point.

Pam: Thank you.

Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.

Michael: Hi, is it over?

Toby: Uh, yes!

Michael: No.

Toby: I can go over it with you.

Michael: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.

Toby: It's over.

Michael: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?

Angela: Email forwards.

Michael: Exactly! Mmwwah [bl*ws kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?

Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.

Michael: Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?

Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.

Meredith: Um... what about office romance?

Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.

Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?

Michael: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.

Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.

Michael: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?

Dwight: Yes.

Michael: She would have definitely slept with me.

Kevin: She wasn't that hot.

Michael: Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!

Toby: Ok, you know, Michael...
Jim: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
Michael: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?

Toby: No.

Michael: What if they made out? In front of everybody?

Toby: Well, that would be...

Michael: At home? And I told everybody everything about it.

Toby: Okay, I'm lost.

Michael: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
Video: [Crossing the Line: Rules for the Modern Workplace]

Michael: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?

Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.

Michael: That's what she said. Pam?

Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.

Michael: That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
Dwight: Hey, Toby.

Toby: Hey Dwight.

Dwight: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.

Toby: Sure.

Dwight: Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vag*na look like?
Toby: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
Toby: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.

Dwight: Good. Good. And...

Toby: I should get back to work.

Dwight: Okay.
Man in Video: In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'

Video: [Scenario 1[/b]: The Natural Redhead]

Roy: Natural redhead.

Actor: Hey, Rach.

Redheaded Actress: Hey, Joe. Mike.

Actor: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?

Darryl: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...

Roy: That's her?

Darryl: Yes, this is the one.

Roy: No!

Darryl: You remember? Yes!

Roy: At the party?

Warehouse guy: You banged her?

Darryl: Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl!

Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
Jan: [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.

Michael: Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
Todd Packer: Don't ever let this little b*tch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.

Pam: I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.

Todd Packer: Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
Michael: So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.

Mr. O'Malley: I love lawyer jokes.

Michael: Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
Michael: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering dr*gs from one guy to another.
Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?

Michael: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.

Jan: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.

Michael: Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.

Jan: Do you need to see the video again, Michael?

Michael: No, I've seen the video.

Toby: [to Jan] He talked the whole time.

Michael: No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
Michael: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.

Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?

Michael: Mmmhmm. Yes.

Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...

Michael: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!

Jan: Michael. MICHAEL!

Michael: [laughing] Come on.

Jan: Michael, please.

Todd Packer: There he is.

Michael: Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]

Todd Packer: There he is. Good one.
Michael: You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.

Jan: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.

Michael: It's... That's...

Jan: That's not my sense of humor.

Michael: Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.

Jan: Wha...

Michael: I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.

Albiny: [to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.

Michael: This guy does it all.

Jan: [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.

Michael: What?

Jan: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.

Michael: So I'm not in trouble?
Michael: I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
Michael: Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...

Albiny: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.

Michael: I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
Pam's Mom: Um... hello.

Pam: [ecstatic] Oh my god!

Pam's Mom: Finally made it!

Pam: Hello!
Pam: I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Pam's Mom: This is all yours?

Pam: Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.

Pam's Mom: Oh, my goodness. That's great.
Todd Packer: So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!" [men laugh] Boom!
Pam: This is where I used to keep my computer.

Pam's Mom: Oh, right! I remember...

Pam: But then I moved it.

Pam's Mom: with the picture.

Pam: Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...

Pam's Mom: Sure.

Pam: So this is like, um, an organization station...

Pam's Mom: [to Roy] Oooooh!

Pam: Hey!

Pam's Mom: Well, there he is!

Roy: How are ya?

Pam's Mom: Hi, handsome!

Roy: You look great!

Pam's Mom: Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?

Pam: Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to k*lling time.

Pam's Mom: Oh, I don't believe that.

Roy: Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?

Pam's Mom: Oh, anything is fine.

Roy: All right, I'll see ya.

Pam's Mom: So which one is Jim?

Pam: Mom!

Pam's Mom: I just wanted to know.

Pam: No.

Pam's Mom: All right. Okay.

Pam: Ten minutes.

Pam's Mom: Okay.

Pam: Then we can go to dinner.

Pam's Mom: I'll make myself busy.
Todd Packer: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]

Kevin: Phyllis?

Michael: No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.

Todd Packer: Ex-squeeze me?

Michael: Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.

Kevin: Packer said it.

Michael: No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.

Phyllis: I'm the same age as you, Michael.

Michael: I don't know about that.

Phyllis: We're in the same High School class.

Michael: Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.

Kevin: You mean where my desk is?

Michael: Yes, your corner. Go.

Kevin: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.

Michael: Mmmhmmm.

Todd Packer: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?

Michael: They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.

Phyllis: Michael! Come on!

Michael: Oooh!

Phyllis: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...

Michael: I'm not worried.

Phyllis: ...report you to HR.

Michael: You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Michael: Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
Pam: He said what?

Michael: Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!

Pam: Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.

Michael: Ohh... OK.
Michael: I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.

Sherri: [on phone] Jan Levinson's office.

Michael: Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.

Sherri: Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.

Michael: Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.

Sherri: I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.

Michael: I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.

Sherri: I know she wanted the name.

Michael: Okay... Sherri?

Sherri: Yeah?

Michael: If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person f*ring you?

Sherri: Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.

Michael: Thanks.

Sherri: Mm-Hmm.

Michael: I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could f*re Sherri.

Sherri: Hey, I'm still here.

Michael: Okay! I'm sorry.

Sherri: Yeah.

Michael: No?

Sherri: OK.

Michael: Bye.

Sherri: Hanging up now.
Michael: I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.

Pam: [entering] You wanted me?

Michael: Yes.

Pam: [notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache?

Michael: Yes.

Pam: Hmm.

Michael: Yeeesh.

Pam: Mm-hmm.

Michael: Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Pam: Why did you put it off until Halloween?

Michael: Because it's very scary stuff.

Pam: I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.

Michael: You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.

Pam: So it's a man?

Michael: No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?

Pam: I just answer the phone.

Michael: And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.

Pam: You're costume is fantastic! [laughs]

Michael: I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]

Pam: Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay...

Michael: Oh, man. Okay, I have to f*re somebody.
Dwight: [eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?

Jim: I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.

Phyllis: That's great!

Jim: Oh, yeah.

Dwight: Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?

Phyllis: What are you? A monk?

Dwight: I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.

Phyllis: Ass.
Michael: Hey.

Oscar: Michael.

Michael: You guys excited about the party?

Angela: Yeah.

Michael: It's gonna be fun.

Kevin: Yeah.

Angela: Yes.

Michael: [looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.

Oscar: What are you implying?

Michael: All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?

Angela: You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.

Michael: Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?

Angela: Yeah.

Michael: Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.

Angela: But we don't keep two sets of books.

Michael: Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Michael: Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.

Kelly: Why is that?

Michael: "Bend It Like Beckham."

Kelly: Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?

Michael: [laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.

Kelly: Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.

Michael: Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
Dwight: Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Pam: Okay, greatest strength.

Jim: Okay, okay...

Pam: A dog-like obedience to authority

Jim: Nice.

Pam: But that doesn't sound good.

Jim: Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]
Jim: Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
Pam: He's a g*n nut.

Jim: Um. He sticks to his g*n.
Angela: Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...

Oscar: Yes?

Angela: ... that has three people...

Oscar: Yeah?

Angela: ... doing the work that could be done by two.

Oscar: This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.

Kevin: Yeah. Oh.
Michael: Who do you think it should be?

Dwight: Jim. Definitely.

Michael: No, Jim brings in money.

Dwight: Phyllis.

Michael: Eh.

Dwight: Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Michael: It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to f*re the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
Dwight: One of the warehouse guys.

Michael: [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?

Dwight: Who is he saying?

Michael: You're right, I didn't even think of him.

Dwight: No, Michael.

Michael: Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.

Dwight: No, not me.

Michael: Yeah... I could.

Dwight: Not Dwight.

Michael: I'm not saying that's what he said.

Dwight: I know that's what he said.

Michael: [listening to his head] What?

Dwight: Tell him, not Dwight.

Michael: That is not a very nice thing to say about him.

Dwight: Tell him to stop.

Michael: Are you kidding?

Dwight: Quiet, you.

Michael: I agree. He'd land on his feet.

Dwight: Make him be quiet.
Angela: Those aren't chips and dip.

Pam: No, I made brownies.

Angela: Uh!

Pam: ... What?

Angela: I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.

Pam: I made brownies.

Angela: And I made cookies. Same category.
Pam: I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Pam: [on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
Jim: Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
Dwight: Stanley, could you come with me, please.

Stanley: No.

Dwight: As Assistant Regional Manager...

Stanley: To the.

Dwight: Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.

Stanley: [laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
Michael: So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?

Dwight: He wouldn't listen to me

Michael: Ahh, come on.

Dwight: If you want to f*re him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.

Michael: I don't wanna f*re Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
Dwight: [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Dwight: Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Oscar: Oh... hey.

Ryan: Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...

Oscar: Oh. [fixes his dress]
Dwight: [on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Pam: Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
Pam: Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.

Jim: Um... it's in Maryland.

Pam: Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.

Jim: Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away]

Pam: Jim...
Dwight: This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?

Michael: Oh, God.

Dwight: I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.

Michael: Fantastic!

Dwight: And I turned it down.

Michael: What?! That would've solved all my problems.

Dwight: Out of loyalty to this company...

Michael: Oh, you idiot.

Dwight: ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.

Michael: If you left, I wouldn't have to f*re anybody.

Dwight: But then you wouldn't have me here.

Michael: Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?

Dwight: It's in Maryland.

Michael: You can call. Can you call 'em?

Dwight: I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.

Michael: Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
Jim: Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna f*re. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.

Michael: [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?

Jim: Um... yes.
Jim: Michael, I really didn't mean to...

Michael: Help. Me.

Jim: I'm sorry?

Michael: I want you to role play f*ring me. I want you to f*re me, and I will take it.

Jim: Oh, you want me to be you?

Michael: Yes.

Jim: Okay.

Michael: I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.

Jim: Oh, are you f*ring Creed?

Michael: No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.

Jim: We should switch seats in order to...

Michael: Yes, that's a good idea.

Jim: Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...

Michael: Aaaahh! I'm gonna k*ll myself!

Jim: Wow.

Michael: I'm going to k*ll myself, and it's your fault!

Jim: That's an overreaction.

Michael: Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.

Jim: Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...

Michael: I... this is Creed.

Jim: Okay.

Michael: I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]

Jim: Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.

Michael: And I'm very angry, and I want...

Jim: [picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.

Michael: I'm gonna k*ll you. I'm going to k*ll you for f*ring me.

Jim: Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...

Michael: Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.
Pam: What happened?

Jim: It wasn't me.

Pam: Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...

Jim: Yeah, I know.
Michael: Uh, hey... Creed?

Creed: Huh?

Michael: Could I talk to you for a second?
Michael: You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.

Creed: What are you telling me?

Michael: I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.

Creed: No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.

Michael: No, you wanna leave.

Creed: No, I wanna stay here.

Michael: Why... why are you making this so hard?

Creed: Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.

Michael: I think you're right.

Creed: Can I go?

Michael: No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.

Creed: Let's fight it.

Michael: Hmm?

Creed: Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.

Michael: What old days? What are you talking about?

Creed: Did you start the paperwork yet?

Michael: It's right here on the desk, yeah.

Creed: You don't have to do this, Michael.

Michael: I can't, I can't...

Creed: Undo it!

Michael: I can't change anything. This is the way...

Creed: No, you have the power to undo it.

Michael: I don't... okay, just listen.

Creed: Michael, undo it!

Michael: Don't...
Michael: Yeah, I went hunting once. sh*t the deer in the leg, had to k*ll it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
Michael: I have to f*re someone today, okay?

Creed: Fine. f*re someone else. f*re Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.

Michael: Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.

Creed: No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.

Michael: Don't...

Creed: Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Michael: Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
Devon: Creed's an idiot, you know that.

Michael: Well, he...

Devon: No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.

Michael: Well, maybe I did.

Devon: Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.

Michael: Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.

Devon: That's why I'm being fired?

Michael: No.

Devon: So you might not look like an idiot?

Michael: No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...

Devon: This is unbelievable!

Michael: I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
Michael: Devon, wait, please.

Devon: What!

Michael: Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.

Devon: [takes the gift certificate and tears it up] Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!

Angela: [watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Pam: Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.

Jim: [motions for her to follow him] Come on.
Jim: That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
Michael: I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
Children: [ringing the doorbell of Michael's Condo] Trick or treat!

Michael: He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.

Kid: I'm a bumble bee.

Michael: You look great! And you're a princess?

Kid: A fairy princess.

Michael: A fairy princess. You're very... .

Kid: I'm a lion.

Michael: You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.

Ryan: [entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie.

Jim: No. They're in the conference room.

Ryan: Good.

Pam: Wait, are those Michael's Levis?

Ryan: Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
Pam: Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
Pam: [to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]
Jan: This is a projection of the county's needs...

Michael: Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.

Jan: Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
Jim: So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. [groan] Years.
Jan: So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-

Michael: I changed it. To Chili's.

Jan: Excuse me?

Michael: Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So.

Jan: You had no right to do that, Michael.

Michael: Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.

Jan: It said that.

Michael: It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.

Jan: Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.

Michael: Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.

Jan: What?
Oscar: She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.

Jim: No...

Oscar: Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.

Toby: That is unbelievable.

Pam: What is going on?

Jim: We are doing worst first dates.

Pam: Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.

Oscar: Ok, that's a joke.

Pam: No, they had to come back for me.

Jim: Wait, when was this?

Pam: Umm... it was not that long ago.

Kelly: Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. [laughs]
Jim: I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.
Michael: Ok, let's do this thing. [to Pam] Wish us luck.

Dwight: Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.

Jan: Thank you.

Michael: [under his breath] Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.

Jan: Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.

Michael: Well...

Jan: Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?

Michael: No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare] Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. [to Oscar] Adios!
Jan: So which way is Chili's?

Michael: Uh, I'll drive.

Jan: Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there.

Michael: It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?

Jan: I know Scranton.

Michael: At all!

Jan: Alright.

Michael: You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-

Jan: If it's a couple blocks away-

Michael: Dar de dar.

Jan: Ok.
Michael: Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was d*ad.
Michael: We should come up with a signal of some sort.

Jan: Why would we need a signal?

Michael: Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-

Jan: What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?

Michael: Well, I... it could be either of us.

Jan: You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.

Michael: Yeees.
Michael: Hello? Christian?

Christian: Yes.

Michael: Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.

Jan: Just Jan Levinson.

Michael: No Gould?

Jan: No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?

Christian: No, not long.

Michael: Uh, Jan, what happened?

Jan: Michael.

Michael: Is Gould d*ad? What uh-

Jan: Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

Michael: Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?

Jan: Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?

Michael: When did this happen?

Jan: We're in a meeting.

Michael: Ok.

Hostess: This way, please.

Jan: Christian.

Michael: Alright, after you.

Christian: Thank you.

Michael: [mouths "Wow" to the camera]
Jan: I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.

Christian: Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-

Michael: Awesome blossom.

Jan: What?

Michael: [to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?

Christian: Sure.

Michael: Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.

Jan: So-

Michael: I heard a-

Jan: If you have a-

Michael: Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?

Jan: Christian, you don't have to listen to this.

Christian: It's ok, I like jokes.

Michael: Ok.

Jan: Just the one.

Michael: Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
Pam: Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

Michael: Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
Pam: [to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em?

Michael: Yes.

Pam: Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-

Michael: No.

Pam: When-

Michael: Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.

Pam: Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-

Michael: Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?

Pam: Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
Jim: Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk]

Pam: It is a screenplay. Starring himself.

Jim: Agent Michael Scarn.

Pam: Of the FBI.

Jim: How long is this? [flips through pages] Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.

Pam: What is that?

Jim: Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like.
Michael: First guy says "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn". And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort". And the third guy says "I gotcha both b*at, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".

Christian: Ohhh no! [laughs] Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!

Jan: [to waitress] Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
Jim: Do we all have our copy of "thr*at Level: Midnight", by Michael Scott?

Everyone: Yeah, yeah.

Jim: Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.

Phyllis: That's the character's name?

Jim: Oh yeah-

Dwight: Ok, you guys should not be doing this.

Jim: Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.

Dwight: You took something that doesn't belong to you.

Jim: Dwight-

Dwight: Brought it in here-

Jim: Do you want to play-

Dwight: Made copies of it-

Jim: The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
Michael: [making the mouth on his tie talk] Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs] That's delicious! I love it!

Jan: We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.

Christian: Well, we are out to save money.

Jan: What's the bottom line?

Michael: Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
Michael: That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.
Michael: Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?

Jan: I don't think Christian has time for that.

Christian: I have time.

Michael: [singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]

Michael and Christian: [singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-

Michael: [singing] Chili's baby back ribs...
Jim: [reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters.

Phyllis: Sir, you have some messages.

Dwight: Not now!

Phyllis: They're important.

Dwight: Ok, what are they?

Phyllis: First message is[/b]: "I love you". That's from me.

Dwight: Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!
Dwight: Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.
Dwight: If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.

Ryan: Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.

Dwight: Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]

Pam: Hey, uh, I have to work late.

Roy: [looks around conference room] You're joking right?

Jim: Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter g*n and sh**t the-

Dwight: Pow! Pow! Pow!

Ryan: Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word.
Kevin: Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
Jim: A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?

Oscar: Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?

Dwight: Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.

Ryan: I forget it, brutha.

Dwight: Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
Pam: Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.
Dwight: D-W-I-G-H-T.
Dwight: Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.

Jim: Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-

Dwight: Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.

Jim: That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam] Hey, are you hungry?

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Yeah?
Christian: So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.

Michael: Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.

Jan: Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really.

Michael: Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.

Christian: It's not fair.

Michael: She's not playing the game.

Jan: We'd been fighting for a while-

Michael: Check please.

Jan: He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.

Christian: You didn't.

Jan: I was stupid.

Michael and Christian: No.

Michael: No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?

Christian: That's right.

Michael: You know?

Christian: You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.

Michael: It's true.

Christian: You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!"
Jim: I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
Jim: [Pam lights a candle] Wow.

Pam: For the bugs.

Jim: Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.

Pam: Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
Christian: Right down the street?

Michael: Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.

Christian: I know.

Michael: It's bad.

Christian: It's terrible.

Michael: It, you know what, it really is.

Jan: Uh- [Michael signals for her to shh]

Christian: I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts.

Michael: Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
Jim: So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.

Pam: What are you going to do with your time off?

Jim: Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.

Pam: [points to Jim's iPod] You have new music?

Jim: Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.
Michael: [waving to Christian] See ya.

Jan: Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes!

Michael: We did it!

Jan: We got it!

Michael: Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.

Jan: I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go.

Michael: What!?

Jan: Let's go.

Michael: Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
Dwight: [waking up on office couch] Michael? Michael? [goes into Michael's office] Michael? [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this? Jan?
Michael: Morning, Pam. Hey.
Michael: No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.
Michael: Hello, Dwight.

Dwight: Did you do her?

Michael: Who.

Dwight: Jan Levinson-Gould.

Michael: Uh, no, no, no Gould.

Dwight: Did you do her?

Michael: This is none of your affair because she is your boss-

Dwight: And she is your boss.

Michael: And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera] Jan, I defend your honor. [to Dwight] Is that all?
Jim: Jan didn't come back for her car last night.

Pam: What!?

Jim: Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?

Pam: Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God. This is Jan's cell.

Jim: No way.

Pam: Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael: I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question[/b]: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me? Excuse me?! [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!
Jim: Some might even say that we had our first date last night.

Pam: Oh, really?

Jim: Really.

Pam: Why might some say that?

Jim: Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.

Pam: Uh hmm.

Jim: Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly] And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.

Pam: We didn't dance.

Jim: You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.

Pam: Swaying isn't dancing.

Jim: Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.

Pam: I have some faxes to get out.

Jim: Oh, come on, Pam. I-
Jim: Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?

Jim: Hey.

Dwight: Hello. Jim?

Jim: What's up, buddy?

Dwight: This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?

Jim: Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.

Dwight: Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.

Jim: Who, Steve?

Dwight: Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.

Pam: Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.

Dwight: No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.

Pam: Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.

Dwight: Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.

Pam: I love these.

Dwight: Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?

Jim: Oh, there it is. J1.

Dwight: But I don't have any...

Jim: Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.

Dwight: [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Michael: Hello, everyone.

Dwight: Good morning, Michael.

Phyllis: Where are we going this afternoon?

Michael: Ah! Ha ha ha!
Pam: Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.

Jim: "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."

Pam: A ski mask and a swimsuit.

Jim: So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.

Pam: And brush our teeth.
Michael: Yeah?

Stanley: Michael.

Michael: Stanley! Bo banley.

Stanley: I need to know...

Michael: Banana fana fo fanley.

Stanley: What we're doing.

Michael: Be my mo manley.

Stanley: You said bring a toothbrush.

Michael: Stanley.

Stanley: Is this an overnight?

Michael: Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?

Stanley: Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?

Michael: Maybe, I don't know.

Stanley: Not maybe. Yes or no.

Michael: Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.

Stanley: In January?

Michael: It's cheaper.
Michael: This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-bl*wing experience.
Michael: It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!

Meredith: All right!

Ryan: I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?

Michael: No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.

Ryan: I'm already in business school.

Michael: Well, this...

Kelly: Wait, Michael?

Michael: Yeah?

Kelly: Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?

Michael: To throw you off the scent.

Kelly: Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.

Michael: Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.

Kelly: I took the tags off already.

Michael: Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
Michael: I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
Michael: Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
Oscar: Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the Competition!" So guess where we went.
Michael: Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?

Darryl: How about the sales department is the sails?

Michael: Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.

Phyllis: A furnace?

Jim: Yeesh, how old is this ship?

Pam: How about the anchor?

Phyllis: What does the furnace do?

Michael: All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!

Jim: I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?

Michael: Titanic?

Pam: I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.

Michael: No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
Jim: Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
Phyllis: Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.

Michael: No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.

Darryl: What?

Michael: The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.

Dwight: Aye aye, Captain.
Michael: [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
Michael: Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.

Dwight: Cool.

Captain Jack: Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.

Michael: I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.

Captain Jack: I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.

Michael: Okay.
Michael: In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.
Michael: Hey, look! I'm king of the world!
Captain Jack: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.

Michael: And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!

Captain Jack: Okay! So...

Michael: Okay! So...

Captain Jack: Please. The life preservers.

Michael: Right.

Captain Jack: They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.

Michael: But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.

Captain Jack: Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...

Michael: I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...

Captain Jack: Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...

Michael: Rock it!

Captain Jack: Please, okay?

Michael: If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!

Captain Jack: Michael.

Michael: Yep.

Captain Jack: Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?

Michael: We're all gonna have a good time tonight!

Captain Jack: Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?

Michael: Hm? Okay. Yep.
Katy: You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?

Roy: Yeah.

Katy: Pam, were you a cheerleader?

Roy: No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!

Katy: That's hilarious.

Jim: It's not hilarious, but...

Roy: Where did you go to school?

Katy: Bishop O'Hara.

Roy: Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?

Jim: Um, no.

Katy: Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!

Roy: I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
Michael: Having fun?

Brenda: Yeah. Everybody's really nice.

Michael: Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.

Brenda: When are you going to start the presentation?

Michael: Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.

Captain Jack: Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!

Michael: So, okay.

Dwight: Limbo, whoo!

Captain Jack: All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?

Meredith: Me.

Captain Jack: Okay...

Dwight: Me! Me, me, me.

Captain Jack: Uh... usually it's a woman.

Dwight: I'm stronger.

Captain Jack: Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
Captain Jack: Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
Dwight: I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
Captain Jack: All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!

Michael: But before that, I have to do my presentation.

Captain Jack: Nope! Dance contest!

Michael: All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! h*t it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
Michael: Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
Dwight: [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?

Angela: Hey, come inside and talk to me.

Dwight: I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Darryl and Katy: [chanting] Snorkel sh*t! Snorkel sh*t!

Roy: Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!

Pam: No, I'm not going to do that.

Roy: Come on!

Darryl: That's what I'm talking about!

Pam: Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?

Roy: I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his sh*t. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!
Pam: It's getting kind of rowdy down there.

Jim: Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

Pam: Sometimes I just don't get Roy.

Jim: Well...

Pam: I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?

Jim: Oh, um... [A long silence.]

Pam: I'm cold.
Captain Jack: So, what's this presentation all about?

Michael: Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?

Captain Jack: Women and children.

Michael: No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.

Captain Jack: That's a stupid analogy.

Michael: Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.

Captain Jack: Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.

Dwight: Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.

Michael: Okay.

Dwight: Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
Katy: I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?

Pam: Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
Captain Jack: Suppose your office building's on f*re. Jim, who would you save?

Jim: Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.

Michael: Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.

Captain Jack: He's just sucking up!

Roy: When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?

Captain Jack: Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
Jim: You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
Roy: Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
Michael: I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?

Roy: No, it was Captain Jack.

Michael: Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!

Captain Jack: We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!

Michael: Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!

Pam: No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.

Michael: Then I'll give you away!

Pam: No, thank you.
Katy: Do you think that'll ever be us?

Jim: No.

Katy: What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?

Jim: I don't know. Let's break up.

Katy: Whoa. What?
Captain Jack: This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.

Meredith: Wow!
Dwight: Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.

Michael: Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.

Brenda: Really? What?

Michael: Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...

Captain Jack: Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?

Michael: It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
Michael: I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
Michael: Is somebody there?

Jim: What happened to you?

Michael: Captain Jack has a problem with authority.

Jim: Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?

Michael: He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.

Jim: What a night.

Michael: Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.

Jim: She was always engaged.

Michael: Roy said the first one didn't count.

Jim: That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...

Michael: Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...

Jim: Yeah, I know.

Michael: Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.

Jim: Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.

Michael: Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.

Jim: She's engaged.

Michael: BFD. Engaged ain't married.

Jim: Huh.

Michael: Never, ever, ever give up.
Dwight: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.

Michael: It's a fake wheel, dummy.

Oscar: ...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good.

Jim: [off camera] Yeah, that's right.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

Michael: Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.

Pam: Michael, what's wrong?

Michael: I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!

Pam: Ok, wait wait wait wait...

Michael: Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!

Pam: Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!

Michael: No, I want you to pick me up.

Jim: What?

Pam: Ok...

Jim: What's going on?

Pam: Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.

Michael: I am hurt. I hurt my foot.

Jim: I'm sorry? Pam.

Pam: [exasperated]

Jim: What is going on?

Michael: I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]

Michael: OH GOD!

Jim: Hey, whoa, Michael...

Michael: Oh God!

Jim: It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.

Michael: OK, buhhhh, I b*rned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.

Jim: You b*rned your foot on a Foreman Grill?
Michael: I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
Michael: Pam, could you come get me?!

Pam: Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.

Michael: Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?

Phyllis: Michael, you should stay home and rest.

Michael: There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?

Kevin: Can you hop?

Michael: I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.

Michael: [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?

Dwight: [silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?

Pam: Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.

Michael: I'm not sick! I'm b*rned!

Dwight: I'm coming Michael!

Jim: Oh...

Dwight: I'm gonna save you!

Michael: Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.

Dwight: Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!

Michael: I don't want Dwight!

Pam: Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?

Michael: I don't have a girlfriend.

Jim: But you said that you went out with her this weekend.

Michael: It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.

Jim: [sounds of a car crash] What was that...

Pam: What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]

Jim: Oh!

Pam: Ohhhhhh!

Jim: He h*t the pole!

Jim: It's broken right, he can't...

Pam: Oh my gosh.

Jim: Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield] Ohhhhhh!

Jim and Pam: Oh my God!

Pam: Is he ok?

Jim: He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!

Michael: Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
Michael: Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.

Pam: You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.

Michael: Did you explain why?

Pam: No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.

Michael: b*rned my foot, Pam.
Michael: Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.

Jim: So, where are you shipping your foot?

Michael: Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...

Dwight: Your foot?
Michael: Thank you. Pam, messages please?

Pam: You didn't have any.

Michael: Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...

Pam: And do my job?

Michael: No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!

Dwight: [holding mini-fan] It slipped.

Michael: What?

Dwight: Sorry.

Pam: It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.

Michael: I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.

Pam: Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.

Michael: No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.

Dwight: Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.

Michael: What? Part of your duties are to what?

Dwight: What?

Michael: You just said "part of your duties are to" something.

Dwight: No, I didn't.

Michael: Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?

Dwight: What is wrong with you?
Michael: Where is my cornbread?

Ryan: Here you go.

Michael: Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?

Ryan: Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.

Michael: Where are the yams?

Ryan: They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach.

Michael: Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?

Ryan: Yes.

Michael: And they had no yams?

Ryan: They had no yams.

Michael: How strange. Because they always have yams.
Dwight: Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?

Pam: You've seen one of these?

Dwight: Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.

Pam: Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.

Dwight: Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.

Pam: Really?

Dwight: Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!

Pam: Oh! Ha, haha.

Dwight: Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan.

Pam: Pan?
Michael: Pam... PAAAM!?

Pam: Oh, God.

Pam: [phone rings] What.

Michael: Come here please.

Pam: Tell me before I come there.

Michael: I want you to rub butter on my foot.

Pam: No.

Michael: Pam, please? I have Country Crock.

Pam: No.

Michael: Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
Dwight: These covers are totally indestructible.

Pam: Really?

Dwight: Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]

Dwight: Oh no, it's broken.

Pam: What?!

Dwight: No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long.

Pam: That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!

Dwight: Yep.
Jim: So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
Pam: Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend!
Michael: No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?
Dwight: Huh. Do you like candy?

Angela: It's alright.

Dwight: Cause you're sweeter than candy.

Angela: What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing]

Angela: Hey!
Toby: Wow, you just dive right into it.

Ryan: You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.

Michael: [loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!

Toby: What, what happened?

Michael: I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.

Toby: What do you need?

Michael: Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.

Toby: I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.

Michael: Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.

Toby: Ryan, is, uh, d*ad.

Michael: No, he's not.

Toby: d*ad.

Michael: I just saw him.

Toby: No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot.

Michael: Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!
Jim: Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?

Pam: No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.

Jim: And that isn't weird?

Pam: Wow...

Michael: Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be d*ad, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?

Phyllis: Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.

Michael: No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.

Creed: When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.

Michael: Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.

Stanley: I'm not disabled and neither are you.

Michael: Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!

Stanley: Mailboxes, Etc.

Michael: Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.

Phyllis: Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder.

Michael: [sigh] I b*rned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!

Dwight: [looking up at Creed] Dad?
Michael: While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.

Jim: Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?

Ryan: Twice.

Michael: Good question. Forrest Gump: ment*lly challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big][/b]: AIDS.

Kevin: I think that's from Big.

Michael: I don't think so, no.

Kelly: Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.

Michael: He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?

Stanley: Uh hmmmm... .

Michael: What you mean uh hmmm... ?

Stanley: I mean I'm learning nothing.

Michael: Ok.

Billy Merchant: Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott.

Michael: Yes, right in here, come on in.

Billy Merchant: Great.

Michael: This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.

Billy Merchant: Sorry I'm late. Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.

Billy Merchant: Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park

Michael: You are so brave. You are so brave.

Billy Merchant: Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time...

Michael: But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.

Billy Merchant: No, I just have a lot of properties to manage.

Michael: Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?

Billy Merchant: I don't know, like 30 seconds?

Michael: Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.

Michael: How did you get in your wheelchair?

Billy Merchant: This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. [Everyone laughs]

Michael: Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.

Billy Merchant: Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here.

Michael: Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.

Billy Merchant: Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore.

Michael: Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
Jim: I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
Billy Merchant: So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of...

Michael: Ok...

Billy Merchant: First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? [to Dwight, whose arms is raised] Yes. Yeah? yes...

Pam: Dwight, you have your hand up.

Michael: Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...

Billy Merchant: You know what Michael?

Michael: Yeah...

Billy Merchant: Let me stop you right there.

Michael: Ok.

Billy Merchant: And leave.
Michael: Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
Billy Merchant: What's wrong with that guy?

Jim: You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he b*rned his foot.

Billy Merchant: No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion.
Michael: [popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!

Ryan: I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!

Michael: You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.

Ryan: You are very welcome.

Michael: Did you get the yams?

Ryan: No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!

Michael: [sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.

Ryan: You sure?

Michael: Yeh.

Ryan: Ok.
Michael: You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Michael: Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
Ryan: I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
Michael: Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.

Dwight: [hits his head on his desk] Uh, ugh, ohhhh...

Jim: Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.

Michael: Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.

Angela: He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him.

Michael: Why don't you go with him?

Angela: I, barely know him...

Dwight: I want Michael to take me...

Michael: I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.

Meredith: You can take my van!

Michael: Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.

Jim: Fine.

Michael: We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.

Jim: Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.

Dwight: Choo choo choo choo choo choo...

Jim: What are you doing? What, stop...

Dwight: Vietnam sounds.

Jim: [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.

Dwight: Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]

Jim: You can't lay down.

Dwight: Want to take a rake... .

Jim: Wake up. [sprays Dwight]

Dwight: Ahh!

Pam: Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.

Jim: I'm just gonna get...

Dwight: Ok, Pam, thanks.

Pam: Get up, get up.

Dwight: You're the best.

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Just keep him awake.

Dwight: It smells like chicken soup.

Pam: I know.

Dwight: I have to go to the hospital.

Pam: I know.

Dwight: Where we going?

Pam: I just want to say goodbye ok?

Dwight: I'll be back, I mean...

Pam: Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.

Dwight: Why?

Pam: It's just hard to explain.

Dwight: Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]

Pam: Oh my goodness!

Dwight: [giggles]

Pam: Come here.

Dwight: Oh, huggy hugs.
Michael: g*n!

Jim: You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
Michael: The rules of g*n are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "g*n" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
Michael: Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?

Jim: Well, I think she has a kid.

Michael: Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.

Dwight: Where are we going?

Jim: Come on, get inside.

Dwight: Where are we going?

Jim: We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.

Michael: Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.

Jim: We're going to the hospital, Michael.

Michael: I know, just sayin'.
Michael: Dwight, what are you drinking?

Dwight: I found it under the seat.

Jim: Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.

Dwight: I'm thirsty.

Jim: Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight]

Dwight: No!

Jim: Give the bottle to Michael!

Dwight: I'm thirsty!

Michael: Give it to me.

Dwight: No.

Michael: Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight] Give me the bottle or you're fired.

Dwight: You can't f*re me, I don't work in this van!

Michael: Give it to me Dwight.

Dwight: No. [takes a drink]

Michael: Give me the bottle!!

Jim: [to Michael] Will you stop?

Michael: Gimme the bottle, Dwight!

Jim: Michael stop.

Dwight: [drinks] Mmmmm...

Michael: Just give it!

Jim: Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]

Michael: Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!

Jim: Stop [sprays Michael]

Dwight: My eyes!

Michael: Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!

Dwight: My eyes!
Michael: Dwight, what is your middle name.

Dwight: Danger.

Michael: [sigh] Something with a "K".

Jim: It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that.

Michael: What do I write under "reason for visit"?

Jim: Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?

Michael: Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".

Jim: So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.

Michael: No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]

Jim: Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]

Dwight: Hi Michael!

Michael: Hi Dwight.
Dwight: Ahhh. Mweehaa

Michael: Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?

Doctor: A head injury.

Michael: Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely b*rned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.

Doctor: [to Dwight] So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.

Dwight: What is that?

Michael: Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?

Doctor: Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.

Michael: Ok, what kinda machine is that?

Doctor: Does the skin look red and swollen?

Dwight: That's what she said.

Michael: That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
Lab Tech: Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment...

Michael: It's ok, they're with me.

Lab Tech: No metal of any kind.

Michael: Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.

Dwight: I don't want to do this.

Michael: Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out.

Dwight: Oh.

Michael: Fine. Fine.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

Jim: Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

Pam: Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?

Jim: Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.

Pam: I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.

Jim: Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.

Pam: Really? Michael went in with him?

Jim: Uh huh.

Pam: Wow.

Jim: But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.

Pam: Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.

Jim: Ok.

Pam: Ok. Bye.

Jim: Bye.
Pam: Hey, Oscar?

Oscar: What's up, Pam?

Pam: I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.

Oscar: Ok...

Pam: I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
Lab Tech: Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two, uh Sir? [Michael tries to put his leg in the scanner] Stop that. Stop. Stop that.

Jim: Not much what's up with you?

Pam: Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.

Michael: Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.

Jim: Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?

Michael: What's up-dog?

Jim: Nothin' much what's up with you?

Michael: Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Michael: Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?

Stanley: I'm on the phone.
Michael: Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog?

Ryan: What's that?

Michael: I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?

Ryan: Huh?

Michael: [low] No, damn it!
Kevin: What does that mean?

Michael: What does what mean?

Kevin: The thing you just said?

Michael: Just forget it.
Michael: Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?

Dwight: What's up-dog?

Michael: Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?

Dwight: Good. How are you doing?

Jim: [mouthing] So close.

Michael: [low] Damn it.
Michael: Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a...

Dwight: Empty mind.

Michael: No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
Dwight: Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?

Angela: He's out sick.

Dwight: That's unacceptable.

Angela: I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]

Kevin: Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Dwight: Michael.

Michael: Yes.

Dwight: Oscar is out sick.

Michael: On a Friday? [Dwight nods]
Dwight: Can I do some of the talking?

Michael: I will do all the talking.

Dwight: Ok, let him know that I'm here.

Oscar: Hello.

Michael: What difference does it make whether your here?

Oscar: Hello?

Michael: Hi, Oscar its Michael.

Dwight: And Dwight.

Michael: Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?

Oscar: Yeah I think I came down with the flu.

Michael: Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.

Oscar: Yeah, I feel terrible about it.

Dwight: Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.

Michael: What are your symptoms?

Oscar: I have the chills.

Michael: Umm, hmmm.

Oscar: I feel nauseous and my heads k*lling.

Dwight: Checks out.

Oscar: Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.

Michael: I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.

Oscar: I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]

Dwight: Ok. First impressions?

Michael: He sounded sick.

Dwight: Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.

Michael: That's exactly what I was thinking.

Dwight: Question? May I investigate?

Michael: Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
Pam: I bought my veil.

Kelly: Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?

Pam: Ummm...

Kelly: Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?

Pam: Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...

Kelly: You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.

Michael: Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be t*rture for you.
Jim: Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
Jim: Hey Michael.

Michael: Hey Jim-bag.

Jim: Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.

Michael: Really?

Jim: Umm, hmm.

Michael: Who else knows?

Jim: Nobody.

Michael: Wow!
Michael: Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
Michael: My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.

Jim: Alright. Great. Thank you.

Michael: [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
Dwight: Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?

Ryan: Yeah, I think I can handle it.

Dwight: Do you think? Or do you know?

Ryan: I think.

Dwight: [low] Oh God, here.
Michael: Hey, whatcha gettin'?

Jim: I'm going with grape.

Michael: Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?

Jim: Which one?

Michael: Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?

Jim: I don't know what you mean.

Michael: P-A-M. P-A

Jim: Uh, uh, ok.

Michael: No it's okay, we're talking code.

Stanley: What is?

Michael: Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?

Jim: I'm going to take off actually.

Michael: Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?

Stanley: Hmm?

Michael: [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Dwight: Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
Dwight: There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Michael: It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.

Jim: Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.

Michael: Not so much.

Dwight: Ok, what is going on here?

Michael: Nothing.

Dwight: Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.

Michael: Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.

Dwight: Ok. So what is the secret Michael?

Jim: Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.

Dwight: Is that true?

Michael: Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.

Dwight: Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.

Michael: Ok.

Dwight: I can tell. I won't let you down.

Michael: Good.

Jim: Thanks.

Michael: Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?

Jim: I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.

Michael: Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.

Jim: No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.

Michael: Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.

Jim: Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out.

Michael: I know just he place.
Michael: [at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Michael: Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
Michael: Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.

Dana: Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.

Michael: We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.

Jim: Nope we're not brothers.

Michael: I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.

Jim: Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.

Dana: And for you?

Michael: Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?

Dana: Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.

Michael: Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]

Dana: Is that what you really want?

Michael: No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.

Dana: Great.
Dwight: Who took all the black ones?

Pam: That's a communal bowl.

Dwight: So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?

Pam: Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.

Dwight: Sniffling how?

Pam: Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?

Dwight: Three.

Pam: Ok, it was the second one.

Dwight: Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?

Pam: Nuh-uh.
Michael: What do you like best about Pam?

Jim: Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.

Michael: Is it her boobs, or...

Jim: Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.

Michael: Really?

Jim: Uh-huh.

Michael: Never get's any of my jokes.

Jim: What about you?

Michael: Her boobs, definitely.

Jim: Wow, that's not what I meant.

Dana: Here you go.

Michael: Oh, thank you.

Dana: And I understand we have a birthday today.

Michael: Ohhh happy birthday Jim!

Dana: Ready girls? Front side.

Hooter's Girls: You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo!

Jim: Thank you.

Michael: Woo! Yeah!

Jim: Thanks, thanks Dana.

Michael: Thank you very much.
Michael: Hilarious. Hey.

Pam: What did you guys talk about?

Jim: [Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.

Pam: I hate you.
Dwight: Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.

Michael: Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.

Dwight: Including prep time?

Michael: Just do it.
Ryan: If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.
Michael: [Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.

Kevin: Michael is that a wig?

Michael: No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?

Kevin: No.

Angela: This is from Hooters.

Michael: Yeah, it's a business lunch.

Angela: Did Toby approve this?

Michael: No he did not. I don't need his permission.

Toby: You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
Michael: Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
Michael: I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.

Toby: I'm not processing this.

Michael: Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?

Toby: He seems fine to me.

Michael: You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?

Kelly: Pam?
Phylis: Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?

Angela: It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
Kevin: Jim has got it bad for Pam.

Creed: Oh ho! Which one is Pam?

Kevin: Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?

Michael: You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
Dwight: As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
Kelly: Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
Jim: Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.
Kevin: Nice... she is so hot.
Pam: Hey.

Jim: Hey.

Pam: Did you find anything good in your desk?

Jim: Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.

Pam: Score.

Jim: It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.

Pam: Big day.

Jim: Big day.

Jim: Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.

Pam: Oh.

Jim: Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.

Pam: Right.

Jim: And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.

Pam: No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.

Jim: Oh you did?

Pam: No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.

Jim: No, no, you saw through me, great.

Pam: So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?

Jim: Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.

Pam: Mmm, hmm.

Jim: And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.

Pam: Cool.

Jim: Ok.
Dwight: Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.

Gil: Who's this?

Dwight: This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?

Gil: Gil.

Oscar: Are you going to tell Michael?

Dwight: How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
Dwight: Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
Jim: Hey.

Michael: I know, I know, I know.

Jim: Umm, what happened?

Michael: I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.

Jim: Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.

Michael: Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.

Jim: Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?

Michael: Yeah I'm good.

Jim: Good.
Ryan: Creed did you organize the menu book?

Creed: Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.

Ryan: No, that was mandatory.

Creed: Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Pam: Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?

Michael: Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.

Pam: Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.

Michael: No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.

Pam: No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.

Michael: It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.

Pam: Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?

Michael: Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
Jim: Ready?

Pam: Yep.
Michael: People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... prost*tute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for m*rder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.

Kevin: So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?

Pam: No.

Kevin: 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Jim: Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Phyllis: Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.

Pam: Yeah?

Phyllis: Yeah, pretty stationery.

Pam: Oh, thanks!

Angela: I didn't get mine yet.

Pam: Uh...
Pam: There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Michael: Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Phyllis: Uh, on or off?

I.D. Photographer: Off.

Phyllis: Okay... [removes glasses]

Dwight: Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?

Phyllis: [leaving the room] Excuse me.

Dwight: Clown paint.
Dwight: I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud g*n in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a r*fle that sh**t potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Michael: That's a nice tie.

Ryan: Thank you.

Michael: That is... who makes that?

Ryan: Um, I don't...

Michael: Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?

Ryan: Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes.
Oscar: It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...

Michael: [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?

Toby: Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.

Michael: What's the problem?

Oscar: Angela!

Toby: It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.

Oscar: Since Christmas.

Michael: So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?

Oscar: No.

Toby: Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?

Michael: Yes.
Toby: Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.

Michael: Yeah?

Toby: These things just have a way of working themselves out.

Michael: Okay.

Toby: It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.

Michael: What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...

Toby: Okay.

Michael: Okay... what?

Toby: That was the right decision for me and my marriage.

Michael: Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
Michael: [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.

Angela: Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.

Michael: No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.

Oscar: What's the next one?

Michael: Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?

Angela: Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?

Michael: Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Michael: [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.

Angela: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.

Michael: Come on, seriously, that?

Oscar: I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore p*rn. I'm talking about the...

Michael: Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.

Pam: Win!

Michael: Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.

Oscar: No.

Angela: That's... no...

Michael: Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.

Angela: How about, I leave it up?

Oscar: How 'bout, she takes it down?

Pam: How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?

Michael: Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.

Pam: Win.

Oscar: Fine.

Angela: But, it...

Michael: [claps his hands twice] It is done!

Pam: Win
Photographer: [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile sh*t] No, you're all good.

Creed: Great. [gets up and leaves]
Pam: Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.

Angela: Oh. Thanks.
Angela: It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Toby: You solved it?

Michael: Yes.

Toby: Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]

Michael: Are those all the other complains?

Toby: Mmm-Hm.

Michael: I would like to see those please.

Toby: I... I can't do that.

Michael: You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.

Toby: That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]

Michael: Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?

Toby: [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Toby: Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Michael: Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Photographer: Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]

Dwight: Oh, he's sure. Just sh**t.

Photographer: [sh**t twice]
Michael: [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.

Pam: Nice.

Michael: You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Toby: Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
Michael: How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble "merely listen to and forgotten..." ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?

Angela: You already did me.

Michael: That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?

Toby: Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.

Michael: Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.

Dwight: Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?

Pam: [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?

Michael: All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.

Pam: Wait, what did it say?

Michael: Uh... [reading]"Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?" [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Pam: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Michael: Here is a Kelly complaint: "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.

Ryan: My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...

Kelly: I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.

Toby: To your HR representative.

Kelly: To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.

Toby: Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.

Michael: [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?

Jim: Dwight tried to kiss me.

Michael: What?!

Jim: And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.

Dwight: That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!

Jim: Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.

Dwight: Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?

Toby: Sure.
Michael: Stanley. [off camera]

Pam: [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!

Michael: [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.

Anglea: I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]

Pam: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Michael: Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true.

Stanley: I didn't say that.

Creed: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]

Michael: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.

Phyllis: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.

Michael: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.

Phyllis: Stanley and I are close, too.

Stanley: We sit close.

Michael: Oh... ok.
Toby: [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Pam: I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.

Jim: Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.

Pam: Don't take her side.

Jim: [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?

Pam: I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.

Jim: You mean your thoughts and feelings?

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Yeah...
Phyllis: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.

Angela: Yes, that's the problem.

Phyllis: I guess so...

Michael: Okay, well... all settled, then.

Phyllis: [whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
Michael: OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Creed: I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Michael: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.

Kevin: I accept your decision!
Jim: Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.

Dwight: That doesn't make any sense.

Jim: Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.

Photographer: [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.

Dwight: No.
Dwight: I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Jim: This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.

Dwight: This is humongous. I am not a security thr*at...

Jim: Oh.

Dwight: And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.

Jim: What did I write?
Dwight: I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.

Toby: Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.

Dwight: What box?!
Phyllis: But I didn't report your snoring-

Stanley: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]

Michael: Uh. Dwight.

Dwight: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.

Michael: Okay! Calm down.

Dwight: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?

Michael: Hey, hey!

Dwight: Him or me?

Michael: Stop.

Dwight: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.

Michael: Okay...

Dwight: Either he goes, or I go.

Michael: Dwight...

Dwight: You choose!

Michael: Stop...

Dwight: One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]

Michael: Oh... kay...
Dwight: I am not bluffing!

Michael: Okay.

Dwight: Okay?

Michael: Yes.

Dwight: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.

Michael: Mm-hmm.

Dwight: I deserve this. You know I do!

Michael: [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security thr*at?

Dwight: You have till five.
Dwight: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!

Michael: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Michael: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert." [flips to another paper] "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
Jim: [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Michael: [reading] "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed m*rder. I think he may be the real m*rder." [flips to another paper] "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
Jim: That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Michael: [reading] "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'."
Jim: Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Michael: "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
Jim: Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Jim: Maybe Stanford would be cool.

Dwight: It's a good market. Higher volume.

Jim: Yeah. Maybe we should both go.

Dwight: I have a girlfriend...

Jim: Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Michael: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.

Dwight: So, you going to transfer Jim or not?

Michael: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.

Dwight: I want an answer by tomorrow.
Michael: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?

Dwight: Fine.

Michael: Good. Okay.
Michael: Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?

Photographer: I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.

Michael: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?

Photographer: You mean digital?

Michael: It'll take like two seconds.

Photographer: 20 bucks.

Michael: Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.

Stanley: You gotta be kiddin' me.

Michael: Come on, everybody.

Dwight: Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Photographer: One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.

Michael: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.

Photographer: Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]

Michael: Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.

Photographer: That'll be another 20.

Michael: What?

Pam: Angela, I want to talk to you about something.

Michael: [off camera] You just press the button.

Angela: What?

Jim: No, Pam.

Pam: [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.

Jim: Pam, it wasn't her.

Pam: What?!

Jim: I'm the one who complained about you.

Jim: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.

Michael: [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.

Jim: You know, it was one day.

Michael: [off camera] That's terrible.

Jim: And I took it right back. It was like...

Pam: Okay.

Phyllis: Oh, dear.

Michael: [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
Michael: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Michael: [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
Michael: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Jim: [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]

Female worker: Okay, Jan will see you now.

Jim: Oh, thanks.
Michael: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.

Dwight: Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?

Ryan: A dime and a nickel.

Dwight: No, I said one of them is not a nickel.

Ryan: But the other one is. I've heard that before.

Dwight: Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...

Ryan: Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.

Dwight: A man is found hanging from the ceiling...

Ryan: He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.

Dwight: A hunter.

Ryan: It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.

Dwight: Damn it!
Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.

Michael: Uhhh... nothing.

Jan: Nothing?

Michael: Yeah, nothing. How was your day?

Jan: I don't care how your day was Michael.

Michael: Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?

Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.

Michael: I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
Michael: Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
Jan: Hi, Pam.

Pam: Hi.

Jan: I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?

Pam: Oh, I don't know if I'm...

Jan: Thanks Pam.
Pam: It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
Dwight: So you excited?

Ryan: Yeah.

Dwight: Very excited?

Ryan: Yes. I'm very excited.

Dwight: Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
Ryan: I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Dwight: I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Ryan: So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?

Dwight: When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Karen: [squeaky chair] Hey.

Jim: What?

Karen: My chair is squeaking.

Jim: Is it?

Karen: You took my chair.

Jim: No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.

Karen: When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...

Jim: So I guess I can't get up.
Michael: Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
Dwight: Do you know where we are, temp?

Ryan: I know where we're not.

Dwight: I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
Andy: Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.

Jim: Sure.

Andy: Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?

Karen: That's it? That's what you came up with?

Andy: I'm acting my heart out here.

Karen: Really?

Andy: Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Announcer: Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.
Pam: Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Michael: Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
Michael: [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.
Dwight: And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.

Ryan: I don't think you know what you're saying.

Dwight: Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?

Ryan: Uh huh.

Dwight: It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.

Ryan: Gotcha.

Dwight: Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.

Ryan: Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
Stanley: I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
Kelly: Because they acted all tough and everything...

Michael: Uh huh.

Kelly: But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...

Michael: [Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?

Phyllis: I'm just saying hi to Bob.

Michael: No, I think you're cutting in line.

Bob: Well settle down, Scott.

Michael: No, I'm not going to settle down.

Stanley: No way.

Michael: Get in the back please.

Stanley: Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.

Michael: Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.

Bob: What a pair of Mary's.

Stanley: This is Pretzel Day.
Ryan: Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.

Dwight: Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Karen: [rocks in squeaky chair]

Jim: [sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,

Karen: stop.

Jim: Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me

Karen: This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.

Jim: fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,

Karen: This is not a proportionate response.

Jim: Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
Andy: I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
Pam: Michael.

Michael: No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.

Pam: Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.

Michael: I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.

Pam: Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.

Michael: Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is bl*wn.

Pam: You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.

Michael: Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
Dwight: It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.

Ryan: Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.

Dwight: You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?

Ryan: Yeah.

Dwight: Come on!
Stanley: Thank you! [takes pretzel]

Michael: Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.

Pretzel guy: We do.

Michael: Thank God.

Pretzel guy: And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.

Michael: Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?

Pretzel guy: The Works. You got it.

Michael: All right! Thank you!
Dwight: Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]

Ryan: Who was that?

Dwight: Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.

Ryan: Is that your Cousin Mose?

Dwight: Yes.
Dwight: Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Dwight: What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?

Ryan: Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.

Dwight: Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's su1c1de?

Ryan: Depression?

Dwight: Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Kelly: I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?

Angela: Sales take a long time.

Kelly: Oh my God, I'm so worried.

Angela: I'm sure Dwight will protect him.

Kelly: I don't know. Dwight's so weird.

Angela: He's not weird, he's just individualistic.

Kelly: No, he's a freak.

Angela: You're a freak!
Dwight: Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?

Ryan: Um, loneliness. Maybe women.

Dwight: Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.

Ryan: No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.

Dwight: Wrestle him to the ground.

Ryan: No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.

Dwight: Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?

Cousin Mose: Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.

Dwight: Where are all the animals?
Dwight: Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Dwight: You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.

Ryan: Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.

Dwight: g*n. The sales call!
Kevin: [Michael is listening to "Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter" and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!

Michael: Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
Dwight: Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.

Ryan: Wait, can you go back?

Dwight: Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Ryan: Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.

Dwight: Good.

Ryan: I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".

Dwight: Right.

Ryan: I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.

Dwight: Uh huh.

Ryan: Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.

Dwight: Exactly. Yes.

Ryan: I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
Michael: Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...

Toby: Second?

Michael: Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.

Kevin: Account...? Michael, what is going on?

Michael: And I will be taking questions.

Pam: Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?

Phyllis: What's on your suit?

Michael: Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
Ryan: They really didn't like me.

Dwight: They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.

Ryan: I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.

Dwight: Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.

Ryan: You drive.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
Dwight: [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.

Ryan: I think about that all the time.
Kevin: Night, Pam.

Pam: Night.

Michael: Hey, what time is it?

Pam: 20 past 5.

Michael: AM or PM?

Pam: PM.

Michael: Oh, good.

Pam: These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?

Michael: Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.

Pam: This is a huge sale.

Michael: Yes. Right. Good.

Pam: Night, Michael.

Michael: Goodnight!

Pam: [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin.

Jim: Ah, hey.

Pam: Oh my God.

Jim: Hi.

Pam: Hi.

Jim: Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.

Pam: Oh.

Jim: And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?

Pam: I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.

Jim: Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?

Pam: Yeah, totally. So...

Jim: So...

Pam: Do you...

Jim: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Pam: Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.

Jim: Oh, good.

Pam: A little different. What time is it there?

Jim: What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.

Pam: Oh, yeah. Right.

Jim: How far away did you think we were?

Pam: I don't know. It felt far.

Jim: Yeah. I have a question for you.

Pam: What?

Jim: How many words per minute does the average person type?

Pam: I type 90.

Jim: Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.

Pam: It's true.

Jim: Ok, I said average.

Pam: 70? How many do you type?

Jim: Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.

Pam: Come on. Tell me.

Jim: No.

Pam: You have to tell me now.

Jim: 65. Ok, no need to laugh.

Pam: No, it's, that's respectable.

Jim: Respectable?
Pam: So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...

Jim: Right.

Pam: Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...

Jim: Ok.

Pam: And, I'm freaking out.

Jim: Yeah.

Pam: That movie is so scary!

Jim: I know!

Pam: But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.

Jim: No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?

Pam: Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.

Jim: No, you're making this up!

Pam: Would I make that up?

Jim: Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.

Pam: Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.

Jim: And how many kitchens?

Pam: I have one kitchen.

Jim: Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.

Pam: It's actually...

Jim: Most apartments these days have like three.

Pam: Three kitchens?

Jim: Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?

Pam: [Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?

Jim: Pam?

Ryan: Yeah. Yeah.

Jim: Pam?

Pam: Um. Ok, bye.

Jim: Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.

Pam: No, I was um...

Jim: Oh, no no.

Pam: You have to go?

Jim: Yeah, uh, well.

Pam: No, I should probably go too.

Jim: Ok.

Pam: I mean, yeah.

Jim: Yeah. Bye Pam.

Pam: Bye Jim.
Stanley: Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.

Pam: Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!

Hannah: He.

Pam: ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.

Hannah: That's his favorite color.

Pam: ...Oh. That's... fun for him.

Stanley: Fantastic.

Michael: Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.

Hannah: Thank youuu.

Michael: Ohh. May I?

Hannah: Uh, sure!

Michael: [climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from "Look Who's Talking." What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Karen: Hey.

Jim: Hey.

Karen: ...Almost done?

Jim: Just about... yup. Now.
Jim: Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
Michael: Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.

Angela: Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.

Jan: [over phone] Mmhmm.

Angela: Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.

Jan: We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.

Michael: I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted r*pist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding.

Jan: When did the check come?

Angela: Last week.

Jan: Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.

Angela: One of the Stamford people is a criminal?

Michael: Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.

Angela: Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?

Jan: Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.

Pam: [whispering] Who is it?

Michael: Hannah?

Kevin: Hmm.

Angela: Hmm.

Kevin: Andy.

Angela: Andy?

Kevin: Hmm. Martin?

Michael: Kuhhhh... you are such a r*cist.

Kevin: Wait, why am I a r*cist?

Michael: Because you think he's black.

Kevin: He is black... right? And...

Michael: Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.

Jan: ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.

Kevin: Yeah!

Jan: Michael?
Michael: Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
Kevin: I wonder what he did.

Michael: In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.

Pam: Why would anyone go to jail for that?

Michael: Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.

Kevin: Cool.

Pam: Okay. Angela?

Angela: Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.

Michael: Good. All right. [everyone leaves]
Jim: [picks up phone] Jim Halpert.

Andy: [over phone] I am so horny.

Jim: ...Okay I can't... help you... with that.

Andy: Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.

Jim: She is dating Ryan, I think.

Andy: Oh, and I care why?

Jim: She's... high-maintenance.

Andy: Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.

Jim: Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.

Andy: Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?

Jim: ...Absolutely you should.

Andy: Jackpot.
Michael: Just... try to be cool.

Dwight: I am cool.

Michael: Okay, are you cool, really?

Dwight: I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.

Michael: Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
Dwight: I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Andy: All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
Jim: I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
Jim: Frisbee-based competitions...

Andy: Are you kidding?

Jim: She...

Andy: I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.

Jim: Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Michael: Hey Martin, how's it going?

Martin: Good. Getting settled, you know?

Michael: Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.

Pam: My dad.

Michael: ...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah.

Jim: Jonas Salk.

Michael: Who?

Jim: Justin Timberlake?

Michael: Oh. Please. Colin Powell.

Karen: Hey I got one.

Michael: Yup.

Karen: Jesus.

Michael: Apollo Creed.
Michael: Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
Martin: So... you all wanna know what I was in for?

Michael: No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.

Martin: Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.

Michael: [laughs] That is awesome.
Kevin: I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Pam: What was prison like?

Martin: Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.

Kevin: You got outdoors time?

Martin: Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games...

Kevin: Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?

Pam: Yeah, some days I never go outside.

Michael: Well, we are running a business, so.

Meredith: What was your cell like?

Martin: Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.

Pam: They have art classes?

Martin: Yeap. Yeah.

Ryan: They have business classes there?

Martin: They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.

Pam: Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.

Michael: Ah. Well. That's not true.

Kevin: I would so rather be in prison.

Ryan: Prison sounds great.

Michael: No you would not.
Michael: This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
Creed: [singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?

Karen: You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.

Creed: Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Andy: Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?

Pam: Wow... I--

Andy: Shh. Think about it. I'll h*t you back.
Pam: Wow. That was... wow.
Michael: Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!
Pam: Michael, it's freezing out.

Phyllis: I can't feel my toes.

Michael: Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?

Jim: What is that, like... five pounds?

Michael: It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.

Stanley: I'm going back inside.

Michael: Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
Michael: Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?

Martin: Yeah, in the rec room.

Michael: Ah. A ten inch black and white?

Martin: Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.
Michael: These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
Jim: Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.

Andy: Yeah.

Jim: Quick question - do you play the guitar?

Andy: I play the banjo.

Jim: Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?

Andy: [singing] You know I can, my man.

Jim: Yup. That's perfect.

Karen: Hey.

Jim: Hey.

Andy: I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.

Jim: Perfect.

Karen: What is going on?

Jim: ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.

Karen: I love it. I want in. Who's the target?

Jim: ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...

Karen: Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.

Jim: Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
Michael: All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!

Angela: Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?

Michael: Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's b*tch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!

Ryan: Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]

Jim: Where... did you learn all of this?

Michael: Internet.

Jim: So, not prison.

Michael: And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.

Jim: What'd you do, Prison Mike?

Michael: I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.

Jim: That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.

Michael: And I nevah got caught, neither.

Jim: Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.

Pam: Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?

Michael: Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.

Andy: Wow. Prison sounds horrible.

Michael: Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. t*nk.

Dwight: Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?

Angela: Don't encourage him, Dwight.

Michael: The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!

Karen: Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?

Michael: No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's b*tch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?

Pam: Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.

Martin: Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison.

Michael: Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]

Jim: Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.

Michael: No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
Kevin: [knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--

Hannah: Shh!
Toby: [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
Toby: Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?

Michael: They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Toby: Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.

Michael: Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.

Toby: You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.

Michael: [unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
Michael: Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
Andy: [singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...

Michael: Jim, could you come in here please?

Harvey: Hi, Jim.

Jim: Hello.

Harvey: I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.

Michael: Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.

Jim: Yeah, you can.

Michael: You know what? Get Pam.

Jim: For this?

Michael: Pam.

Harvey: Pam, you look very hot today.

Jim: Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.

Pam: Great.

Harvey: Me so horny. Me love you long tim.

Michael: Oh, that is gross.

Pam: Who is 'Long Tim'?

Michael: Damn it.

Harvey: Long time. Me lobe yoy long time.

Jim: Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?

Pam: I would love to meet Long Tim.

Jim: Yeah. Right?

Pam: Yeah.

Harvey: You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.

Jim: Ok.

Pam: Ok. Bye Harvey.

Harvey: Boobs.
Kevin: Angela.

Angela: What?

Kevin: That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?

Angela: They arrived this morning.

Kevin: Are you sure? It is a big deal.

Angela: Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?

Kevin: ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Andy: Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
Angela: Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]

Dwight: Everything is fine. You are in the clear.

Angela: Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.
Michael: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.

Andy: Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?

Michael: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.

Andy: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.

Michael: Oh.

Andy: Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.

Michael: Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.

Andy: Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.

Michael: Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.

Phyllis: We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.

Karen: Oh, uh, thanks.

Michael: Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.

Stanley: Pass.

Michael: You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.

Stanley: ... I'll take the kid.
Ryan: I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass."
Michael: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.

Dwight: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?

Jim: Yup. I'll trade.
Jim: Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
Andy: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.

Michael: Dwight?

Dwight: Yup?

Michael: Here ya go. [throws laundry]

Dwight: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?

Michael: Please.

Andy: He does your laundry?

Michael: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race." [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?

Karen: Wait, "Amazing Race" like, the biggest sale wins?

Michael: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.

Ryan: Is there a prize?

Michael: Just bragging rights.

Phyllis: Then how is this "Amazing Race"?

Michael: It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.

Dwight: Come on!!

Phyllis: Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]

Michael: Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!

Andy: Bueno.

Phyllis: Do you have a pole?

Karen: Let's go get a broom.
Jim: Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?

Dwight: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
Michael: Here we go.
Andy: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
Andy: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?

Michael: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.

Andy: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
Angela: Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?

Pam: Really?

Angela: Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.

Pam: Ok. Sure.

Angela: Ok.
Karen: Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?

Phyllis: Um-hmmm.
Ryan: Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?

Stanley: You want the lead?

Ryan: Yeah, if you don't mind.

Stanley: Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
Dwight: Leave the keys.

Jim: You still do that thing?

Dwight: Leave the keys!
Andy: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?

Michael: Hawkman.
Andy: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.

Michael: [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Jim: After you sir.

Dwight: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten att*cks are from the rear.

Jim: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will att*ck you from the front.

Dwight: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Pam: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.

Angela: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.

Pam: That's great.

Angela: Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?
Michael: Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?

Buyer: Yep.

Michael: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.

Andy: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a r*fle from the crow's nest. Also sh*t a deer once.

Michael: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.

Andy: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.

Buyer: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.

Michael: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.

Andy: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.

Michael: No.

Andy: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.

Michael: Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.

Andy: Ow.
[ Newpeat Quote ]
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?
Andy: Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper?

Michael: Yes.
Andy: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.

Michael: Ah, no. Don't worry about it.

Andy: I really 'Schruted' it.

Michael: What?

Andy: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?

Michael: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
Phyllis: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.

Karen: Yeah, thank you.

Phyllis: Hey, how's Annie?

Kenny: Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?
Julius: Stanley Hudson.

Stanley: Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?

Julius: Great, great, great.

Guy: Stanley.

Stanley: So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.

Ryan: Hi.

Stanley: I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?

Ryan: Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Julius: Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?

Ryan: Oh...
Jim: We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.

Man: 'Kay. 'Kay.

Dwight: Can I use your phone?

Man: Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Dwight: Thanks.

Jim: Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.

Dwight: [On Phone] One...

Jim: We have discount prices on ink cartridges...

Dwight: Three...

Jim: And, also, any forms that you are going to need...

Dwight: Seven...

Jim: We can custom make them.
[ Newpeat Quote ]
Pam: Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
[ Newpeat Quote ]
Pam: Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.

Kevin: How much did you win?

Pam: $100.

Kevin: I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.

Pam: Cool. Congratulations.

Kevin: Thanks, so sweet.
Stanley: Ha ha ha! And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Man: We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.

Dwight: Sure.

Jim: Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?

Man: It's very.

Phone: Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.

Dwight: Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.

Jim: [Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin.

Kelly: Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.

Jim: Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.

Kelly: Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]

Dwight: Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.

Man: All right, I get it. We got a deal.

Jim: Thanks.
[ Newpeat Quote ]
Pam: Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.

Angela: That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.

Pam: Oh.

Angela: I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.

Pam: Oh?

Angela: Mmm-hmm.

Pam: Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.

Angela: Well then. Have a nice day.
Karen: Thanks. That was fun.

Phyllis: Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.

Karen: Thank you.

Phyllis: I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.

Karen: That's nice.

Phyllis: You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Andy: Hey boss. Got a minute?

Michael: Yes, Andy.

Andy: I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?

Michael: He didn't say.

Andy: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?

Michael: No, you are remembering it wrong.
Michael: Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
Dwight: I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.

Jim: Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.

Dwight: My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.

Jim: We should go on a double date.

Dwight: No thank you.
Jan: Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc."

Michael: I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]

Andy: Oh, doggie.
Karen: Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?

Jim: Sure. Look at you!

Karen: Yeah.
[ Newpeat Quote ]
Jim: Beesley, coffee?

Pam: No, thanks. I had some already.

Jim: All right.

Pam: Oh, but, hey, Jim.

Jim: Yeah.

Pam: I won an art contest today.

Jim: No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five]

Pam: Thanks.

Jim: Which one was it?

Pam: I sent in one of my watercolors.

Jim: Cool.

Pam: It was the new one I did.

Jim: Oh

Karen: You ready Jim?

Jim: Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Congratulations.

Pam: Thanks.

Jim: Big deal.
Dwight: Hey, we nailed the sale!

Michael: Where were you this morning?

Dwight: I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.

Michael: Why do you lie, liar?

Dwight: I am not a liar.

Michael: You are lying right now.

Andy: It sure seems like he is lying.

Dwight: Stay out of this, you!

Michael: I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.

Dwight: Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.

Michael: Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.

Dwight: That's what she said.

Michael: Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
Dwight: It's going to be ok.

Angela: How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.

Dwight: That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.

Angela: I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.

Dwight: Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Karen: So, let me ask you a question.

Jim: Ok.

Karen: Did you ever have a thing for Pam?

Jim: Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?

Karen: I moved here from Connecticut...

Jim: Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?

Karen: 'Kay.
Dwight: Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Andy: Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp.
Dwight: I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.

Michael: Good luck.
Ryan: Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
Angela: Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
Dwight: One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Jim: Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves]

Karen: What happened on your sales call?
Andy: Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.

Dwight: I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Dwight: For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
Dwight: I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Dwight: How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Dwight: There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
Dwight: [in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
Andy: [to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays "Rockin' Robin"]

Jim: Is that you singing?

Andy: All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.

Jim: Nice job.

Andy: Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing]

Jim: You gonna answer it?

Andy: I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.

Jim: Yikes.

Andy: Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.

Jim: Thank you.

Andy: I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna...
Jim: I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
Michael: Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.

Andy: The cost of doing business.

Michael: Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...

Andy: Was the top salesman...

Michael: I said 'was'.

Andy: [chuckles] Addition by subtraction.

Michael: What does that even mean? That is impossible.

Andy: Mmmm. Yeah you're right.

Michael: But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
Oscar: Hey, everyone.

Kevin: Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?

Oscar: Oh, that's very funny.

Kevin: Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.

Oscar: [sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.

Angela: Oscar.
Andy: Hey, boss.

Michael: Hey, what's up.

Andy: Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?

Michael: Yep.

Andy: Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?

Michael: I don't know. Maybe.

Andy: Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?

Michael: Bathroom.

Andy: Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
Andy: [lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
Angela: Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?

Oscar: The one of all women?

Angela: Yeah.

Oscar: Because I'm gay?

Angela: No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.

Oscar: OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.

Angela: Thank you. [sniffles]

Kevin: Can I join too?

Angela: Never.
Staples Guy: You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.

Dwight: [scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Michael: Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.

Pam: Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?

Michael: Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.

Pam: Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.

Michael: Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.

Andy: Feel ya, dawg.

Michael: Yeah, do you?

Andy: Absolutely.

Michael: What did I say?

Andy: You said... [makes gibberish noises]

Michael: Huh.

Andy: Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it.

Michael: Oh, no.

Andy: Oh, no.
MIchael: Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
Oscar: I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.

Michael: No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.

Oscar: Michael --

Michael: No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.

Oscar: Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.

Michael: Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
Dwight: Need any help?

Lady: Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.

Dwight: Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.

Lady: Okay. [moves away]
Andy: I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
Jim: Hey.

Karen: Hey.

Jim: So Andy is in rare form today.

Karen: Yeah, you should not encourage him.

Jim: Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.

Karen: Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.

Jim: Fine. Party pooper.
Michael: Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Andy: 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ["displays" Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]
Jim: Hey, Ryan?

Ryan: What?

Jim: You wanna pull a prank on Andy?

Ryan: Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.

Jim: I liked you better when you were the temp.

Ryan: Yeah, me too.
Michael: Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?

Phyllis: Sort of. He had a lot of clients.

Michael: Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?

Stanley: Oh, sure, we talk all the time.

Michael: Really?

Stanley: No.

Michael: Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.

Phyllis: No. Sorry.
Phyllis: Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be expl*sive.
Paris: Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.

Dwight: I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.

Paris: So um, where were you workin' before this?

Dwight: Dunder-Mifflin.

Paris: What kind of company is that?

Dwight: [scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.

Paris: I never heard of 'em.

Dwight: Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?

Paris: You gonna be like that, huh?
Paris: I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter.
Andy: [singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.

Jim: Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?

Pam: Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.

Jim: Okay, good. Stay right here.

Andy: [after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.

Jim: [hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages?

Pam: Nope.

Jim: So weird.

Pam: [takes the phone] Hmm.
Michael: Nice to have Oscar back.

Angela: Yeah.
Andy: Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?

Jim: No.

Andy: Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
Pam: Angela?

Angela: Oh. [hands Pam tape]

Pam: Is everything okay?

Angela: No.
Andy: What's going on?

Jim: What are you talking about?

Andy: Where is my FREAKING phone?!

Jim: You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.

Andy: Maybe you're in the ceiling!

Jim: Okay.

Andy: [trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!
Angela: I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.

Michael: Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.

Angela: Yes.

Michael: Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?

Angela: None of them. Especially not Andy.
Michael: Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.

Andy: Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?

Michael: Um.

Andy: Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. sh*ts. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll h*t the tiz-own.

Michael: No. I don't want to do any of that.

Andy: Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.

Michael: No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.

Andy: Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna h*t the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?

Pam: Yeah.

Andy: Sure? Okay.
Dwight: [to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.

Michael: Hey.

Dwight: Hey.

Michael: What's up?

Dwight: Same old.

Michael: Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.

Dwight: Oh my God, she told you?

Michael: Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.

Dwight: Accepted.

Michael: How's this place treating you?

Dwight: [scoffs] The boss isn't funny.

Michael: Oh, well.

Dwight: I don't get to wear my ties.

Michael: No. I'm sure.

Dwight: So?

Michael: So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.

Dwight: I don't want to do your laundry anymore.

Michael: We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.
Jim: [inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.

Pam: I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker]

Jim: [imitating Andy] "It's not freakin' funny!"
Angela: Are you enjoying your fiesta?

Oscar: Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.

Michael: Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!

Everybody: Yay. [scattered appalause]

Angela: Welcome back.

Dwight: Thank you.

Michael: Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?

Dwight: You did this for me? [camera pans to "Welcome Back Oscar" sign]

Michael: Guilty.
Creed: Oh... Where did you get this stuff?

Meredith: Gerty's.

Creed: Which aisle?

Meredith: I don't remember.

Creed: Well, draw me a map, mama.
Michael: Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.

Pam: No, I will not.
Michael: So does this remind you of your childhood right now?

Oscar: It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.

Michael: Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
Jim: Hey.

Karen: [sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?

Jim: [long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.
Michael: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]

Dwight: Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Michael: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
Andy: So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.

Marcy: Oh, hi. You must be Andy.

Andy: Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!

Marcy: That's right, it's so good to meet you.

Andy: It's so good to meet you!

Marcy: Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?

Andy: Yeah.

Michael: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?

Kevin: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.

Michael: Huh?

Kevin: I almost d*ed. I... I went into this skid---

Michael: Pop quiz.

Kevin: ...What?

Michael: Why is today a special day?

Kevin: I almost d*ed.

Michael: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...

Ryan: You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.

Michael: In business school, Kevin. Business school.

Kevin: Wow.
Ryan: If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right?
Michael: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Michael: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?

Dwight: "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.
Dwight: Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Michael: Will they throw their hats, you think?

Ryan: What?

Michael: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.

Ryan: Y-You understand nobody's graduating.

Michael: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.

Ryan: ...It doesn't apply.

Michael: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!

Ryan: Quit it!

Michael: We have fun.
Roy: I can't for your art show tonight.

Pam: Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.

Roy: I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.

Pam: Thanks.
Pam: I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Roy: Love ya.

Pam: You too.
Jim: Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Kelly: I can't believe you're back together with Roy!

Pam: Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.

Kelly: Oh my God. You're so in love now.

Pam: Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.

Kelly: Oh, art show!

Pam: I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.

Kelly: ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
Michael: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!

College Student: ....Dude.
Dwight: ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]

Pam: Dwight, what are you doing?

Dwight: Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!

Karen: Oh my God!

Dwight: BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!

Stanley: Goooood bye.

Angela: [on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Michael: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.

Ryan: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...

Michael: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Dwight: We have... a bat... in the office.
Toby: The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Angela: Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Jim: Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.

Dwight: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.

Jim: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...

Dwight: What? What's so wierd?

Jim: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Ryan: And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.

Michael: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
Dwight: [sighs] This is your job, Halpert.

Jim: Ow!

Karen: Oh, what happened?

Jim: That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.

Karen: But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.

Jim: What? ... No. It b*rned me. I... bizarre.

Dwight: No... no. One crisis at a time.
Dwight: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Michael: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?
Toby: Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.

Pam: Oh! No, you should go.

Toby: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Michael: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.

Ryan: Michael.

Michael: ...And products!

Ryan: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.

Michael: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.

Business Student #1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?

Michael: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
Karen: Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.

Jim: Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.

Karen: What glare?

Jim: The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
Dwight: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I sh*t one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Dwight: Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--

Creed: Sure.

Dwight: --to use sudden v*olence.

Creed: Okay.

Dwight: Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?

Creed: What size?
Business Student #2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?

Michael: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.

Business Student #2: Has anyone ever come back?

Michael: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.

Business Student #3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?

Michael: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?

Business Student #3: ...What?

Michael: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?

Business Student #1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.

Michael: ...Wait, Ryan said that?
Kelly: What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.

Creed: Animals can't feel pain.

Kelly: Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!

Dwight: Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!

Kelly: AHH! k*ll IT! k*ll IT! k*ll IIIT!

Kevin: [locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Michael: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.

Business Student #2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?

Michael: David will always b*at Goliath.

Business Student #1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...

Michael: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?

Business Student #1: But in the big picture...

Michael: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a f*re trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Ryan: ...It wasn't personal.

Michael: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.

Ryan: Pack my--?

Michael: You heard me, pack your things.
Meredith: I really want to come out!

Creed: Good night, Mary Beth!
Jim: So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?

Dwight: Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.

Jim: Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.

Dwight: Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Dwight: Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Pam: ...And it's all from the same series.

Woman: Oh.

Pam: Called 'Impressions.'

Woman: Oh.

Pam: Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.

Woman: Maybe one day.

Pam: I hope so.

Woman: Mmm.

Pam: I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?

Roy: Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?

Pam: Hey, Kenny.

Kenny: Hey Pam.

Roy: How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
Dwight: Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]

Meredith: Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!

Dwight: Hold still, woman!

Meredith: Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!

Dwight: ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
Roy: It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.

Pam: Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.

Roy: To my place?

Pam: Maybe, I'm a little tired.

Roy: Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.

Pam: Thank you.
Ryan: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to f*re me.

Michael: f*re you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.

Ryan: To the annex? Where... Kelly is?

Michael: A good manager doesn't f*re people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Oscar: You're the one who said we needed more culture.

Gil: This is culture to you?

Oscar: It's her first try.

Gil: Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.

Oscar: Meaning what?

Gil: Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.

Oscar: Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.

Gil: Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art.
Artist: Thanks for coming.

Michael: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.

Pam: Oh, Michael.

Michael: Wow! You did these... freehand?

Pam: Yep.

Michael: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?

Pam: What do you mean?

Michael: I don't see a... price.

Pam: Um... you wanna buy it?

Michael: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?

Pam: Uh-huh.

Michael: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.

Pam: [hugs Michael] ... Thank you.

Michael: What?

Pam: Do you have something in your pocket?

Michael: ...Chunky. Do you want half?

Pam: No thank you.

Michael: Okay.
Michael: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
Kelly: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...

Ryan: It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.

Kelly: I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...

Jim: [to Pam] Hey.

Jim: [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?

Dwight: That is a demerit.

Jim: [reads demerit] "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.

Dwight: You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.

Jim: Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?

Dwight: [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.

Jim: Lay it on me.

Dwight: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.

Jim: Now that sounds serious.

Dwight: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.

Jim: Which would be me.

Dwight: That is correct.

Jim: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.

Dwight: What's a dis... what's that?

Jim: Oh, you don't want to know.
Pam: [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?

Phyllis: I think I just got flashed.

Pam: What? Really?

Phyllis: In the parking lot.

Pam: Oh, my God.

Dwight: [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!

Jim: OK, I'll call the real police.

Andy: What happened? What can I do to help?

Jim: [on the phone] OK.

Andy: I'll check the web.

Jim: [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.

Pam: [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?

Phyllis: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.

Angela: Phyllis. You're a married woman.

Creed: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Creed: If that's flashing, then lock me up.
Pam: [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.

Ryan: [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]

Michael: What's happening?

Pam: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.

Michael: Really? Is she OK?

Pam: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.

Michael: OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]

Angela: What is so funny?

Michael: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?

Kevin: I'm guessing not.

Michael: [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.

Jim: Mm... not really, no.

Pam: It's disgusting and demeaning.

Michael: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]

Toby: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...

Michael: What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]

Toby: What's going on?

Michael: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]

Toby: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.

Michael: Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.

Toby: I don't think the women in this office -

Michael: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.

Toby: I was at a parent-teacher conference.

Michael: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Michael: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
Jan: [on speakerphone] Michael, ...

Michael: Huh?

Jan: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.

Michael: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -

Jan: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.

Michael: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.

Jan: $300?

Michael: I... uh, well, I don't know.

Jan: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?

Hunter: [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.
Dwight: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Michael: [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.

Dwight: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.

Michael: OK.

Dwight: [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.

Michael: This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.

Dwight: Look at that one.

Michael: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Michael: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.

Dwight: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.

Jim: [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?

Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?

Pam: Phallus?

Dwight: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Pam: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Phyllis: I didn't really get a good look.

Pam: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.

Karen: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous.

Dwight: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.

Karen: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.

Dwight: Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Pam: [reads memo] "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]

Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the t*rrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and h*t 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.

Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.

Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?

Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?

Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.

Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?

Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?

Dwight: [eating banana] Mm, less than three.

Michael: That is not current.

Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a h*m*.

Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.

Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.

Michael: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Michael: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.

Creed: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?

Michael: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.

Meredith: I don't remember doing that.

Angela: What a surprise.

Michael: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.

Dwight: Alien. Blagh!

Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.

Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.

Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.

Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.

Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.

Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.

Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.

Karen: That - it's the same thing.

Phyllis: Michael.

Michael: Yes.

Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.

Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.

Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.

Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.

Dwight: I wish I could menstruate.
Dwight: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Karen: Can we just get back to work?

Michael: Ye - OK, yes.

Angela: This is not work talk.

Michael: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
Karen: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Angela: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Michael: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!

Dwight: Have you finished with the sketch?

Pam: Yeah.

Dwight: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.

Pam: Uh, Phyllis got a good look.

Dwight: Hmm.
Dwight: [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Pam: [tires screeching] Oh.

Angela: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're d*ad.

Meredith: Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]

Pam: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.

Meredith: My car, my rules.
Kevin: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?

Jim: No. Thank you, though.

Kevin: You aren't curious?

Jim: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.

Kevin: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.

Jim: I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.

Kevin: [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.

Jim: Go crazy.

Kevin: [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
Andy: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.

Dwight: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.

Andy: This guy looks like a real deviant.

Dwight: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.

Andy: Aye, aye, Cap'n.

Dwight: More like, "Aye, aye, General."
Michael: [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]

Meredith: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.

Michael: Many women are competent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on.
Dwight: [marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we know.
Jim: [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.

Kevin: Yes.

Toby: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?

Jim: Anna Maria's.

Ryan: What's the occasion?

Jim: Six-month anniversary. What?

Ryan: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.

Jim: No, we've been dating for six months.

Ryan: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -

Jim: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.

Ryan: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Michael: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.

Kelly: Thanks, Michael.

Angela: Thank you, Michael.

Michael: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.

Pam: What do you want to dish about?

Michael: Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.

Pam: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?

Kelly: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.

Michael: What, um... what do you think of role-play?

Phyllis: Oh, it can be fun.

Michael: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.

Karen: It's a pretty common one.

Michael: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.

Angela: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Angela: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Pam: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.

Michael: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.

Pam: Oh, my God.

Michael: [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.

Karen: That is not healthy behavior.

Michael: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.

Pam: Michael, you need to get out of this.

Michael: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.

Pam: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]

Michael: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
Pam: Read the pros first.

Michael: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.

Phyllis: She does have very nice clothes.

Karen: OK, OK. Um, cons.

Michael: Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts[/b]: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.

Pam: What was the last one?

Michael: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.

Phyllis: No, the one before that.

Michael: I'm unhappy when I'm with her.

Pam: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.

Michael: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.

Karen: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.

Michael: Yeah, that's smart.

Pam: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.

Michael: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.

Phyllis: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?

Michael: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.

Phyllis: My mom taught me that.
Michael: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.

Pam: No one said it has no calories.

Michael: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Michael: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Kevin: [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.

Toby: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.

Creed: What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.

Kevin: You're in here.

Creed: I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]

Kevin: [all get up to leave] OK.
Creed: [wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Michael: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.

Karen: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?

Phyllis: Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
Pam: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Angela: [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.

Michael: Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply] It's Jan. What do I do?

Karen: Answer it.

Pam: Don't answer it.

Michael: OK, it stopped.

Kelly: [bang] Whoa.

Meredith: [tires screeching] Crap.
Jim: [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Kelly: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?

Michael: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...

Pam: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.

Michael: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]

Pam: I think I've got it.

Michael: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?

Pam: I don't think we really need that, Michael.

Michael: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Pam: You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Andy: Think we'll find him?

Dwight: Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.

Andy: [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?

Dwight: No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]

Andy: Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.

Dwight: Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]

Andy: Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.

Dwight: You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Michael: OK, I am really going to do this.

Pam: Good luck, Michael.

Michael: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]

Karen: OK, remember, be strong.

Michael: I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.

Pam: Don't leave a -

Michael: [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.

Jan: Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.

Michael: Thank you.

Jan: So... we're good?

Michael: Abso-fruit-ly.

Jan: [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.

Michael: No... No...

Jan: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?

Michael: Yeah.

Jan: OK. [voice on phone] "It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..."

Michael: Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -" [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."

Jan: Oh. [door closes]
Michael: [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Dwight: [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.

Jim: Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.

Dwight: Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.

Jim: No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.

Dwight: Ugh. I'm hanging up.

Jim: Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.

Dwight: You have information about the sex predator?

Jim: I saw him two minutes ago.

Dwight: Where?

Jim: In the women's bathroom, above the sink.

Dwight: [hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!

Michael: And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.
Jim: There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.
Pam: I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
Michael: We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]

Andy: Dah! Come on!

Michael: Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.

Oscar: It's never gonna happen.

Kevin: Dude, you gotta believe.

Michael: Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?

Jim: [to Pam] Wait for it.

Michael: Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo." [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]

Everyone: Oh! Yes!

Michael: [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.

Kevin: That was so awesome.

Michael: That was awesome. Thank you.
Michael: Some days I am just on f*re. What can I say?
Meredith: Hey... there he is.

Jim: Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?

Meredith: I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.

Jim: Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so...

Meredith: Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.

Jim: Haha...

Meredith: Anyway, I have this Sharpie...

Jim: Uh-huh.

Meredith: And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?

Jim: MmmHmm...

Meredith: [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?

Jim: Oh yeah.

Meredith: [whispers] I'll read this when I get home.

Jim: Alright...
Pam: Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.

Michael: Oh, does he?

Pam: He does.

Michael: Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.

Jim: Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?

Michael: And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Michael: Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...
Michael: The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.

Dwight: That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.

Jim: Actually it sounds like you are.

Dwight: Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?

Kelly: If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?

Michael: No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.

Stanley: Yes, please let us know.

Dwight: I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.

Angela: Waste of time.

Michael: What's that, pipsqueak?

Angela: Waste of time. The website's going to win.

Dwight: You believe a computer can b*at me?

Angela: I don't care, but yes.

Dwight: Well I will prove you wrong.

Angela: I don't care, and you won't.

Dwight: We'll see.

Angela: I won't be watching, and I won't.
Pam: Dwight mercy k*lled Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Phyllis: Stanley, you're dancing!

Stanley: No I'm not.
Ryan: Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.

Voice of Thomas Dean: I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
Ryan: Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.
Andy: And this is where I will record your sales.

Dwight: Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.

Andy: And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.

Jim: Or zipadeedoodaah.

Andy: I can't tell if he's mocking me.

Dwight: Just ignore him.

Andy: Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.

Jim: I was... mocking.

Andy: Thank you.

Dwight: I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.

Andy: Yes like a chime or a bell...

Jim: Or a gong.

Dwight: Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.

Andy: Yes!
Kevin: Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?

Angela: Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?
Phyllis: Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Phyllis: So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?

Angela: I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.

Phyllis: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.

Angela: It is awful. You've made this day awful!

Kevin: Maybe you could just change the U into an A.

Angela: Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?

Michael: Ohh, lunch party.

Angela: It's supposed to say launch!

Michael: Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.

Angela: I care!
Angela: Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still d*ad.
Andy: Twenty seconds to go time.

Dwight: Got it. Carb up.

Jim: Really? Power gel?

Dwight: Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.

sAndy: Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this sh*t. Aaannnddd go!

Dwight: Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.

Jim: What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?

Dwight: Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.

Jim: What?

Pam: He's going through a break-up.

Jim: Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.

Andy: [bl*wing air horn] Yeah!

Dwight: Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.

Pam: What kind of prank are you thinking?
Dwight: What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.

DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Who am I?

DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] You tell me.

Jim: [dictating to Pam] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.

DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.

DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] How do I know this isn't Jim?

DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] What is a Jim?
Dwight: It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Michael: Okay.

Pam: Yes it's too tight.

Kelly: Waaay too tight.

Michael: Really?

Oscar: This is why I'm here?

Kelly: Why is it so tight?

Michael: It's the European cut.

Angela: Is just looks bad.

Michael: Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?

Tech Guy: Setting up the web-cam for the party.

Michael: Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?

Kelly: Depends... how much have you eaten already today?

Michael: I had um, one of those danishes.

Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.

Kelly: You had carbs? That's awful.

Pam: Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan.
Michael: Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.

Jan: [on phone] My friends? Michael, I was terminated.

Michael: Just...

Jan: Is it really that important to you?

Michael: Yeah.

Jan: Alright.

Michael: Thank you.

Jan: Go by yourself.

Michael: Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.

Jan: Well...

Michael: Do I have your permission to invite Carol?

Jan: What? No Michael!

Michael: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
Dwight: Ohhhhhh!

Andy: Website check please.

Meredith: Three hundred and five.

Andy: Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.

Meredith: Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.

Andy: You my friend are in a very close second.

Meredith: Four-oh-two.

Andy: Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?

Meredith: What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Michael: So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.

Jim: Sure we'll go.

Michael: Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.

Jim: Oh I'm sorry. What?

Pam: One of the tickets is for him.

Michael: Just let me know who the winner is.

Pam and Jim: Not it.

Jim: Nope.

Pam: I won.

Jim: Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.

Pam: Tie goes to the girlfriend.
Dwight: No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]

Jim: How's it going?

Dwight: Fine. Good.

Jim: Yeah?

Dwight: Yeah.

Jim: You look a little worried.

Dwight: I do not look worried.

DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] You do look worried.

DwightKSchrute: [on monitor] Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read...

Pam: Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.

Jim: Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.
Angela: I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.

Phyllis: I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.

Angela: Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?

Phyllis: Yes.

Angela: Goodie.
Jim: Hey man.

Darryl: What's up man?

Jim: What's going on?

Darryl: Make a delivery.

Jim: Oh yeah?

Darryl: Kelly ordered this online.
Dwight: What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.

Kelly: But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."

Dwight: Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!

Darryl: Who knows?

Dwight: Return it! Return it now!

Darryl: Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.

Dwight: Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.

Darryl: Who's it?

Darryl: Here you go.

Kelly: Thanks.

Darryl: So you still missing Ryan?

Kelly: Not so much anymore.

Darryl: Mmmmm.
Dwight: I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
Dwight: Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.
Michael: Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' g*n.

Jim: I'm driving?

Michael: Yes. Thank you.

Jim: Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.

Michael: Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?

Angela: Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.

Michael: If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.

Dwight: Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.

DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.

Dwight: I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?
Dwight: Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?

Andy: No ! [bl*ws air horn and dances]

Dwight: Huh?!

Angela: Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!

Dwight: Did you see the board?

Angela: There's still an hour.
Michael: You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]

Jim: Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.

Michael: Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...

Jim: Yeah.

Michael: Same sort of stuff in here.

Jim: It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.

Michael: Mmwa. Mmwa.

Jim: What was that?

Michael: Leaving Pennsylvania.

Jim: Oh. Two kisses.

Michael: One for me one for Jan.

Jim: Gotcha.

Michael: You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?

Jim: That would be fun.

Michael: Wanna come over Friday?

Jim: Uhhh. Can't.

Michael: After work you guys...

Jim: Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?

Michael: Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...

Jim: Mmmkay...

Michael: What are you doing?

Jim: Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.

Michael: No.

Jim: Yep.

Michael: No, I'm sure that's not. Na...

Jim: Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?

Michael: Yes.

Jim: Yep.
Michael: Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.
Michael: You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
Michael: Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?

Jim: Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.

Michael: Yeah. I withdrew too.
Andy: Four! Three! Two! One!

Dwight: Yes!

Andy: Woo!

Dwight: Woo!

Andy: After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.

Dwight: Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.

Andy: Fifty-two reams!

Dwight: No no no the first part.

Andy: Dwight has defeated the computer.

Dwight: Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.

Angela: I didn't ask you to do it for me.

Dwight: You didn't have to.
Angela: How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
Angela: Hello, Pam.

Pam: Hello.

Angela: Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.

Pam: Um... uh... I'll get back to you.

Angela: Let me know.
DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] You b*at me. You are the superior being.
Michael: Alright who wants to party?

Oscar: Why aren't you in New York?

Michael: Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.

Stanley: You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.

Michael: I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a k*ller party right here in Scranton.

Angela: Thank you.

Michael: Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?

Andy: He b*at the computer.

Michael: Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
Michael: This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.
Michael: How we doing on time?

Angela: The party starts in an hour.

Michael: Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.

Angela: Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?

Michael: Mmmhmm.

Angela: Something made of ice?

Michael: Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.

Angela: Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?

Michael: I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...

Angela: Chocolates? Someone famous?

Michael: Yes

Angela: Cool music.

Michael: Uh...

Angela: Confetti.

Michael: I want it...

Angela: Go-Go dancers?

Michael: I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"

Angela: I can't do this.

Michael: Yes you can.

Angela: I can't do it.

Michael: Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?

Angels: Okay. Okay.

Michael: No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
Andy: What do you think of Angela?

Dwight: I think she's efficient.

Andy: No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N.

Dwight: I hadn't noticed.

Andy: You hadn't noticed she's a woman?

Dwight: [impatient sigh]

Andy: I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?

Dwight: I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.

Andy: Isn't that part of the fun?

Dwight: No. I think you should date Kelly.

Andy: She works here too, how is that any different?

Dwight: Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.

Andy: [raised eyebrows] Okay.
Michael: Good news.

Stanley: We get to go home?

Michael: Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?

All: [murmurs of approval]

Kevin: Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?

Michael: Same thing.

Kevin: No, no.

All: [disagreeing with Michael]

Michael: You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.

Kevin: Oscar, talk to him.

Oscar: Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?

Michael: Pizza by Alfredo.

All: [shouts of disapproval]

Michael: Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?

All: Medium amount of good pizza.

Michael: [sighs, walks back into office]
Kevin: Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Phyllis: You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.

Angela: It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.

Phyllis: [b*lls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]

Angela: Ow!
Phyllis: That seemed to shut her up.
Andy: Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. [Camera pans to Kevin giving an "are you kidding me?" look]

Andy: Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.

Andy: Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?

Angela: What?

Andy: Hello.

Angela: I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
Andy: They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
Michael: Yup.

Pam: The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.

Michael: You don't have to say it like that.

Pam: I said it normal.

Michael: Hey

Pizza guy: Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.

Michael: Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.

Pizza guy: The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.

Michael: Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.

Pizza guy: I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.

Michael: You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?

Oscar: It's not pizza.

Michael: Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.

Pizza guy: [shrugs]

Michael: [sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?

Pizza guy: Not my problem.

Michael: It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.

Pizza guy: Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.

Michael: I'm not giving that to you.

Pizza guy: Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.

Michael: No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.

Pizza guy: What?

Michael: You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.

Pizza guy: I'm not going in there.

Michael: Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.

Pizza guy: This is stupid.

Michael: No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.
Stanley: You find anything?

Kevin: We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.

Oscar: Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"?

Stanley: Why can't you guys do it?

Oscar: Because we're looking up jail time.

Stanley: Fine.
Dwight: I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Pizza guy: Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed.
Michael: You ready to give me my discount now?

Pizza guy: No.

Michael: Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?

Pizza guy: What kind of business is this?

Dwight: We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.

Michael: Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.

Pizza guy: You better think about what you're doing.

Michael: No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot sh*t, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?

Pizza guy: Sales?

Michael: Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.

Pizza guy: You're such a loser.

Dwight: What did you just call him?

Pizza guy: A loser.

Dwight: What did you say?

Pizza guy: A loser.

Michael: Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.

Dwight: I can make him talk, Michael.

All: Michael, Michael

Michael: Stop talking all at once!
Jim: You need to let him go.

Michael: Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?

Jim: Yes.

Michael: You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.

Jim: Yes, but not by kidnapping.

Michael: I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.

Jim: As a hostage.

Michael: I think you're over-thinking it.

Jim: I think you're under-thinking it.

Michael: Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...

Jim: Ransom.

Michael: Trouble. Okay, alright.

Jim: What did he say?

Michael: He said no.

Jim: So, we should let him go.

Michael: No, no.

Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.

Angela: I have to hang these.

Pizza guy: Why are you looking at her like that?

Dwight: Hey!
Kevin: What's going on?

Jim: Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.

Michael: Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?

Kevin: We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Angela: I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.

Meredith: I think it looks good.

Angela: That's why you're not in charge Meredith.

Andy: Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.

Angela: How did you, um, where did you...

Dwight: It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.

Angela: Will you help me put it over there?

Andy: Yes I will.

Angela: Okay.

Andy: Excuse me.
Andy: I stole it!
Oscar: Thank God.

Pam: Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.

Michael: I'll just wave and introduce myself.

Jim: Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?

Pam: I'm all over it.

Jim: Okay.

Jim: What have we got here?

Kevin: Good pizza.

Jim: Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?

Kevin: Different stuff.

Jim: Which one's this? Perfect.
Jim: Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?

Pam: Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.

Jim: And that's when I knew. You?

Pam: You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.

Jim: That was the moment that you knew you liked me?

Pam: Yep.

Jim: Wow, can we make it a different moment?

Pam: Nope.
Manager: Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.

Ryan: And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.

Michael: Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen b*at your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.

Ryan: Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.

Pizza guy: If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor.
Angela: Ow! What are you doing?

Andy: You said your upper back itched.

Angela: I didn't ask you to scratch it.

Andy: Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.

Angela: I'm not dating you.
Andy: So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.

Dwight: [smiles]

Andy: But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.

Dwight: [kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Michael: Hey, have you seen Jim?

Kevin: I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.

Dwight: Ahh-chaa!

Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

Dwight: I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.

Pizza guy: I can hear you, man.

Dwight: Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!

Michael: Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.

Dwight: You had to, what other choice did you have?

Michael: I could have paid for the pizza.

Dwight: Well, yeah.

Michael: Oh my God, oh my God.
Michael: This is Michael.

Ryan: Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.

Michael: You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

Ryan: Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]

Michael: [to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.

Dwight: What will you do?

Michael: I will open the door.

Dwight: Yeah.

Michael: And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.

Dwight: So, I'm paying full price?

Michael: Yes.

Dwight: Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.

Michael: See ya, drive safely.

Michael: [pizza guy flips him off] Okay.

Dwight: Now what?

Michael: Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.

Dwight: Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.

Michael: Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
Jim: A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.

Pam: Ah-ha.
Andy: [answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on.

Andy: [Andy plus two voices on the phone singing] If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me.

Voice #1 on phone: Hey how'd it go?

Voice #2 on phone: Yeah, what'd she say?

Andy: I don't know yet, I have to call you back.

Voice #1 on phone: You have to give us something...

Andy: I'll call you back.

Angela: I have to go clean up after the party.
Michael: What a horrible day.

Dwight: Blah.

Michael: Bluh.

Dwight: Uhh.

Michael: Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?

Dwight: What?

Michael: I'm going to get it.

Dwight: Coopers has calamari.

Michael: Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.

Dwight: Tokyo?

Michael: New York. Wanna go?

Dwight: Yes.

Michael: Alright, you drive.

Dwight: Okay.
Dwight: Nice.

Michael: Here we go.

Dwight: Woo-hoo.

Michael: Mmm.

Dwight: Yum.

Bartender: I'm sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.

Michael: Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.

Man: Hey, you're the Scranton guy.

Michael: Guilty.

Man: I liked your statement tonight.

Michael: Oh, thanks. This is the guy that b*at the computer.

Man: Oh, very cool. It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

Michael: Yeah.

Man: See you later.

Dwight: Later on.

Michael: [mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.

Dwight: And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.

Michael: I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.

Dwight: I started a f*re with my cheese pita.

Michael: I made it with my cheese pita.

Dwight: I date Indian girls.

Michael: I started a f*re, I started a f*re.

Dwight: Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.

Michael: And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...

Dwight: I don't get that, I don't understand that.

Michael: Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.

Michael: Wanna head back?

Dwight: Yeah, let's go.

Michael: Coat! [throws coat at Pam]
Pam: Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
Michael: Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
Pam: He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
Michael: Get me Armani.

Pam: A suit?

Michael: On the phone.

Pam: Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.

Michael: Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
Michael: I owe you an apology.

Pam: You finished the movie.

Michael: Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.

Pam: No. Go ahead.

Michael: Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
Pam: Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to k*ll me.
Micahel: So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.

Jan: You do.

Michael: I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.

Jan: Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.

Michael: We already have a sofa. So why do---

Jan: A futon's not a sofa.

Michael: It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.

Jan: I know what a futon is, Michael.

Michael: I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?

Jan: It costs what it costs.

Michae: No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.

Jan: We have gone through this.
Michael: Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
Michael: It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings]

Pam: [on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you.

Jan: Conniving little runt. Put him through.

Michael: Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!

Ryan: [on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.

Michael: Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.

Ryan: I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.

Michael: Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.

Ryan: Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.

Michael: [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
Jim: [talking on phone] Sure, I can hold.

Dwight: [picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!

Jim: Hey Dwight.

Dwight: None of your business, Jim.

Jim: Do you run the bed and breakfest?

Dwight: It is not a B and B.
Dwight: Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Jim: Does the Department of Health know about this?

Dwight: I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.

Pam: Hello, I'm looking for a room.

Dwight: Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.

Pam: It says here you cater to the eldery.

Dwight: Where did you read that?

Pam: Trip Advsior.
Dwight: Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Dwight: How many in your party?

Pam: Two?

Dwight: We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Jan: So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.

Michael: Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.

Jan: Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
Michael: Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
Dwight: One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.

Angela: What about my cherub figurine?

Dwight: You took that with you.

Angela: No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.

Dwight: You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.

Angela: Fine.
Dwight: My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Kevin: The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?

Michael: You can not, I have a thing tonight.

Kevin: Dammit.

Jim: Uh, Michael.

Michael: What?

Jim: That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.

Michael: Oh no, I have a thing tonight.

Jim: Darn it!

Pam: sh**t!

Michael: How about this weekend?

Jim: No, can't.

Pam: We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.

Michael: Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.

Jim: Where are you going out tonight?

Michael: You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.

Jim: I wouldn't understand or a secret?

Pam: You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
Michael: I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.
Jim: I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.

Pam: The Beets Motel.

Jim: The Beets Motel? That is, wow.

Pam: Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!

Jim: How are you doing this?

Pam: I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car]

Pam: Oh my gosh.
Michael: I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.

Nick: What's going on here?

Michael: Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.

Nick: We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---

Michael: No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
Dwight: We have three rooms, each with a different theme.

Pam: What are the themes?

Dwight: American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.

Pam: Irrigation.

Jim: Nice.

Dwight: I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?

Jim: Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.

Dwight: No.

Jim: Not even Harry Potter?

Dwight: No. Jim, come on.

Mose: But you promised.

Dwight: Mose, bags! Now!
Dwight: Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
Nick: Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.

Michael: These meetings are useless.
Nick: I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?

Michael: Very inspirational. [laughter]

Nick: We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.

Co-Worker 1: Or a woman.

Michael: Or a trained seal. [laughter]

Nick: You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends]
Jim: Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.

Pam: What?

Jim: Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being m*rder here tonight.
Jim: You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.

Dwight: Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Michael: Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

Stanely: [on the phone] Yes, who is this?

Michael: I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---

Stanely: Michael?

Michael: ...Stanley?

Stanley: Why are you calling me here at home?

Michael: [Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---

Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?

Michael: [speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?

Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]
Stanley: [on the phone] When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
Michael: Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.

Nick: [hangs up phone] My office.

Michael: You bet.
Nick: Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.

Michael: Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---

Nick: A few more minutes is a waste of our time.

Michael: It is not a waste of our time.

Nick: This is a trading game.

Micael: No.

Nick: You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.

Michael: Vikram doesn't have my people skills.

Nick: Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.

Michael: Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
Dwight: [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Michael: What did you get tonight?

Vikram: Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.

Michael: Oh, that looks good.

Vikram: Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?

Michael: I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.

Vikram: Enjoy.

Michael: Thank you.
Vikram: I was a surgeon back home.

Michael: Really?

Vikram: Oh yeah.

Michael: Wonder what I would've been back home?

Vikram: Well this is your home.

Michael: I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.

Vikram: Uhh, no.

Michael: I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
Jim: [Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?

Pam: Yeah. Coward.
Pam: [Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?
Michael: You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets b*at up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.

Co-Worker 2: Dude, you should review movies. [other co-workers agree]

Michael: I actually wrote a movie.

Co-Worker 3: Really?

Michael: I'm writing one, yeah.

Co-Worker 3: What's it about?

Michael: Um, sort of a spy, thriller...

Nick: What's so captivating? [everyone stops talking, go back to work] I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.
Pam: [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.

Dwight: [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?

Jim: Hey Dwight.

Dwight: Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.

Jim: Does Mose have nightmares?

Jim: Oh yes. Ever since the storm.

Dwight: Is everything satisfactory with your stay?

Jim: Yeah, yeah.

Dwight: Great.

Jim: Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.

Dwight: Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.

Jim: Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]
Co-Worker 2: Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?

Co-Worker 3: We'd love for you to come, Michael.

Michael: Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.

Co-Worker 2: All right, next time dude.

Michael: Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?

Jan: You drive, I had too much wine.

Michael: Okay. How's yoga?

Jan: I didn't go.

Michael: Wh-Why not?

Jan: I just didn't!

Michael: Okay.

Jan: How was improv?

Michael: Good night Vikram.

Vikram: Good night.

Michael: Hey, congrats on the bonus.

Vikram: Thank you Michael.

Michael: I'm gonna have it one of these nights.

Vikram: Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.

Michael: Good night.

Vikram: Good night.
Pam: Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?

Dwight: Pam.

Jim: You okay?

Dwight: I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]

Ryan: Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
Ryan: Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?

Michael: Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.

Ryan: Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.

Michael: Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
Michael: Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
Michael: And the best way to start is to h*t start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You h*t register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.

Ryan: Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?

Michael: Why?

Ryan: You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?

Michael: No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.

Ryan: I'm your boss.

Michael: My other boss, Mr. Figaro.

Ryan: You have another job?

Michael: What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.

Jim: Are you a cocktail waitress?

Ryan: You can not have another job if it affects your work here.

Michael: It won't.

Ryan: It did, all ready.

Michael: Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]

Kelly: You're so funny.

Ryan: Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.

Kelly: I invited him.

Ryan: It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.

Darryl: There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.

Kelly: Okay. [makes out with Darryl]

Darryl: Hey, get off.

Kelly: Umm, see you later tonight.

Darryl: I have plans later.

Kelly: Okay, bye honey.

Ryan: How long until you actually get this presentation ready?

Michael: Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?

Ryan: You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.

Michael: Huh, okay.

Ryan: What?

Michael: It's whoever, not whomever.

Ryan: No, it's whomever.

Michael: No, whomever is never actually right.

Jim: No, sometimes its right.

Creed: Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.

Andy: No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.

Oscar: Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.

Michael: Not a native speaker.

Kevin: I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.

Ryan: Do you really know which one is correct?

Kevin: I don't know.

Pam: It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.

Phyllis: Yeah, that sounds right.

Michael: Well it sounds right, but is it?

Stanley: How did Ryan use it? As an object?

Ryan: As an object.

Kelly: Ryan used me an object.

Stanley: Is he right about that?

Pam: How did he use it again?

Toby: It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.

Michael: Thank you.

Toby: To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.

Michael: No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.

Ryan: Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Michael: I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.
Michael: Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---

Mr. Figaro: Lipophedrine

Michael: And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

Mr. Figaro: Never heard of it.

Michael: In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.

Mr. Figaro: Are you quitting?

Michael: I am.

Mr. Figaro: Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.
Michael: I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
Andy: So.

Pam: What's up?

Andy: Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.

Pam: You're being gross.

Andy: Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.

Pam: What moves?

Andy: I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.

Pam: I can't believe that's not working.

Andy: Yeah.

Pam: Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.

Andy: Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.

Pam: She's very religious.

Andy: Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.

Pam: Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.

Andy: Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.

Pam: That's right, you did.

Andy: Yeah.
Pam: Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
Michael: Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.

Kevin: I do gamble Michael.

Michael: Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?

Kevin: The mob.

Michael: Do you know anybody in the mob?

Kevin: [shakes head no]

Michael: Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
Kelly: What do you mean you have plans tonight?

Darryl: I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.

Kelly: Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.

Darryl: My daughter.

Kelly: Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.

Darryl: That was cold.

Kelly: [makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]
Phyllis: He's always been terrible with money.

Stanley: I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.

Kevin: Yeah, women be shoppin'.

Meredith: I can't believe he has a second job.

Oscar: He's not even good at his first one.

Michael: Hey guys.

Kevin: Shh.

Michael: What'cha talking about? [camera pans to each face in the break room] Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---

Pam: Michael.

Michael: Hey, hey, hey.

Oscar: Michael, are you having money problems?

Michael: Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?

Oscar: You heard me correctly.

Michael: Oh, I hate monkeys.

Pam: What's going on, why do you have a second job?

Michael: I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.

Pam: Doesn't Jan have money?

Michael: I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.

Kevin: True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.

Michael: I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]

Oscar and Stanley: You just put it back in your pocket.

Michael: Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
Darryl: Hey, let's call this what it is.
Darryl: It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
Kelly: Well, I just need to know where this is going.

Darryl: Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.

Kelly: Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---

Darryl: Slow down, think it over.
Kelly: Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?
Creed: Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.

Michael: No you didn't.

Creed: Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
Creed: Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Michael: How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.

Creed: You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.

Michael: That is a good point.

Creed: Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.

Michael: Like the witness protection program.

Creed: Exactly.

Oscar: Not at all.
Michael: I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.
Michael: I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
Oscar: Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.

Michael: I didn't say it, I declared it.

Oscar: Still, that's not anything.
Oscar: This is a lot of credit card debt.

Michael: Yeah, tell me about it.

Oscar: Mmm.

Michael: You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.

Oscar: Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.

Michael: Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.

Oscar: Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?

Michael: That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.
Andy: I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.
Oscar: Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.

Michael: Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.

Oscar: The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.

Michael: Right.

Oscar: This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.

Michael: How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
Pam: Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background] Angela.
Oscar: Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.

Michael: No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.

Oscar: She has to know.

Michael: We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.

Oscar: Michael, this is a presentation tool.

Michael: You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

Oscar: I'm done!

Michael: No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.

Oscar: Jan is smart.

Michael: She poses.
Jim: Dwight, how's the hotel business?

Dwight: Stupid.

Jim: Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?

Dwight: No.

Jim: Maybe you should.

Dwight: Maybe you should. Whatever.
Pam: We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.

Jim: The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.

Pam: Table making never seemed so possible.

Jim: You will never want to leave your room.

Pam: The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
Dwight: I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.

Pam: We really did. It was fun.
Oscar: So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.

Jan: [on phone] You're broke?

Michael: Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?

Jan: [on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.

Oscar: Jan.

Jan: [on phone] Yeah, what?

Oscar: Michael left.

Jan: [on phone] Okay, where did he go?

Oscar: I don't know.

Jan: [on phone] Well, is he coming right back?

Oscar: I don't think so.

Jan: [on phone] I'll be right there.
Michael: What am I doing? I am bl*wing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
Angela: [to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
Pam: Dwight.
Dwight: Uhh-mmm [moaning]

Jim: Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?

Dwight: [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.

Jim: Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.

Dwight: Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]

Jim: Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.

Dwight: [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Pam: Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]

Jim: Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.

Pam: Okay.

Jim: Yeah?

Pam: Yeah.

Jim: Okay.
Pam: Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
Jim: Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
Oscar: Jan, he went running that way.

Jan: Alright. [throws her keys at Oscar]
Michael: [singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.

Jan: Michael.

Michael: Hey Jan.

Jan: What's going on?

Michael: Not much, what's up with you?

Jan: Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?

Michael: I'm out of answers Jan.

Jan: What does that mean?

Michael: I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.

Jan: Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.

Michael: I don't know that.

Jan: Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.

Michael: I'll stay off the grid.

Jan: Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.

Michael: Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.

Jan: Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.

Michael: That's really nice of you to say.

Jan: Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?

Michael: I think the engineer left.
Dwight: [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
Michael: Don't sell your implants please.

Jan: I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.

Michael: That's nice though.

Jan: It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.

Michael: It looks cute though.

Oscar: [Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.

Dwight: Bow down before Recyclops.
Jim: Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
Dwight: Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
Jim: The next year he really stepped things up.
Dwight: Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
Jim: A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
Dwight: Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Jim: Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was att*cked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
Dwight: Recyclops will have his revenge.
Jim: I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
Pam: Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.

Dwight: Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]

Stanley: Oh, is today Recyclops Day?

Dwight: Yes.

Stanley: I thought you were k*lled by Polluticorn.

Dwight: Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]

Andy: That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.

Dwight: Humans are terrible for the environment.
Pam: The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.

Jim: Mmm.

Pam: A world where you truly can be anything you want.

Jim: God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
Michael: [seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]

Pam: That's great.

Michael: I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]

Pam: Sure.

Michael: Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.

Meredith: And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Michael: Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
Andy: [doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]

Pam: Don't do the twirl.

Phyllis: Lose the twirl.

Dwight: The twirl sucks.

Kevin: Michael, I hated the twirl.

Andy: [still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!

Michael: Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.

Phyllis: Yeah, good. Don't do it.
Michael: I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
Oscar: The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.

Michael: Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the b*llet points.

Oscar: Those are the b*llet points.

Michael: Well, could you condense it please?

Oscar: That's as simple as I can make it.

Erin: Michael? The limo's here for you.

Michael: It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.

Erin: He said limousine, so...

Kevin: [at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.

Michael: They sent a limo.
Michael: Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
Michael: [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.

Dwight: What kind of mileage does this baby get?

Erin: It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.

Oscar: This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.

Michael: Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.

Dwight: Calves. Calves all the way.

Andy: I'm so jealous right now.

Michael: Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-

Limo Driver: Car seats eight.

Michael: What?

Limo Driver: The car seats eight.

Michael: The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.

Jim & Pam: No thanks.

Ryan: I'll use it when you're done.

Michael: [others start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.
Oscar: The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Michael: [in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.

Andy: Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?

Michael: Definitely.

Dwight: Smells like it.

Michael: Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.

Dwight: Word.

Andy: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Michael: [the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?
Jim: Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?

Ryan: Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.

Jim: But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.

Ryan: The company's probably going under, though.

Jim: Could go either way.

Ryan: Seems like it's leaning one way.

Jim: Maybe we should just wait and find out.

Ryan: Definitely.

Jim: Ok.

Ryan: So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?

Jim: Nah. Might as well do it now.
Andy: Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?

Michael: I will have to answer.

Dwight: I'll ask you a question.

Andy: Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.

Dwight: Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?

Michael: No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.

Andy: This is your big day. Come on.

Michael: Oh, my god. This is it.
Laurie: Mr. Scott?

Michael: Yes.

Laurie: I'm Laurie.

Michael: Oh, hi.

Laurie: Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

Michael: Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.

Laurie: Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.

Michael: Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -

Andy: Kay.

Dwight: Good luck, Michael.

Michael: See you later.
Michael: [walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.

Laurie: After you, Mr. Scott.

Michael: Thank you.

David: Michael.

Michael: Hello.

David: So glad you could make it.

Michael: Thank you.

David: How was the ride?

Michael: Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.

David: I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.

Alan: It's nice to meet you, Michael.

Michael: It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.

David: Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.

Michael: Ah. [bows] Your eminence.
Registrar: For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.

Dwight: Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
Dwight: I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
Oscar: Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.

Andy: Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.

Oscar: Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.

Andy: Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?

Dwight: How is he gonna have grandkids?
Michael: You guys ever protect the president?

Security: No.

Michael: What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?

Security: Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado.

Alan: Alright, guys. You ready?

Michael: Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]
Alan: Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever. [boos from the crowd]

Michael: [to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.

David: It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.

Michael: [accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.

Alan: The shareholders need to empower our leadership -
Woman in line: I'm just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place?

Man in line: Sure.

Dwight: No. You will not.

Woman in line: Excuse me?

Dwight: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?

Woman in line: It'll just be a second.

Dwight: Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Alan: ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.

Dwight: [loudly applauds] Yes.

Alan: In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. [scattered applause] Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford. [applause]
Jim: Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?

Phyllis: Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.

Jim: Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.

Phyllis: Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.

Jim: I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.

Stanley: That doesn't make you a boss.

Phyllis: It's not like you can f*re people or anything.

Jim: Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?

Phyllis: Ryan.

Stanley: Can't say.

Phyllis: Sorry. Plastered.

Jim: Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam]

Pam: Stuff gets around. I don't participate.

Jim: Who here heard it from Ryan?

Kevin: Does and email count?

Jim: Yes.

Kevin: Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]

Jim: I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment, is the only one who raises her hand]
Pam: I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Oscar: These questions are bush league.

Andy: You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.
Andy: I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
David: [over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.

Shareholder: You're a criminal.

Michael: Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -

Female Shareholder: Limousine?

Michael: Yes.

Second Shareholder: You're all corrupt. You should be in jail. [crowd agrees]

Alan: Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions.
Ryan: Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?

Creed: I don't know, man. I just don't know.
Jim: I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just f*re him?

Pam: Can you actually f*re people?

Jim: To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.

Pam: Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.

Jim: Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.

Pam: Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.

Jim: Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.

Pam: Well, you'll figure it out.
Alan: Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions.

Third Shareholder: You haven't said anything yet and we're headed for bankruptcy. [crowd agrees]

Michael: [board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -

Fourth Shareholder: How are you gonna fix the company?

Michael: Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
Jim: Hey, Ryan. How's it going?

Ryan: [playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...

Jim: Mmm-hmm.

Ryan: That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.

Jim: Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.

Ryan: Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?

Jim: You know what?

Ryan: What?

Jim: I think I know the problem.

Ryan: Great.

Jim: I think you seem distracted.

Ryan: Yep, that is a problem.

Jim: But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.

Ryan: Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.

Jim: I am, too. Let me show you.
Michael: Wow. Things are really picking up.

O'Keefe: What was that about?

Michael: What?

Alan: You were supposed to wave.

Michael: I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

David: What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.

Michael: We tell them the plan, right?

David: There is no plan.

Michael: Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.

O'Keefe: Excuse me?

Michael: Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.

O'Keefe: Who the hell is this guy?

Michael: I am the guy who roused that crowd.

David: Yes.

Michael: Got them on their feet.

David: Yes.

Michael: They were so happy down there.

David: Yes.

Alan: Who cares?

Michael: Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.

David: No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.

Michael: Well, I'm texting him, so.

David: Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.

Michael: It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]
Michael: Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]
Jim: I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.

Ryan: Mmm-hmm.

Jim: Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.

Ryan: I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.

Jim: Right.

Ryan: Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.

Jim: [laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office]

Ryan: [from behind the door] Is there internet?
Oscar: Ummm...

Michael: Tell them what you told me. This is genius.

Oscar: Ok

Michael: Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -

Oscar: Um..

Michael: It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.

Oscar: I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.

Michael: That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.

Oscar: I think this has gone very well and I thank you.

Michael: O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?

Oscar: Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.

Michael: Wow, man. That -

Oscar: What?

Michael: That was embarrassing.

Oscar: For me.

Michael: For me, too. You embarrassed me.

Oscar: You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]

Michael: Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.

O'Keefe: He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?

Michael: Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
Michael: [zipping through the hall while texting]
Michael: Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
O'Keefe: He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.
Michael: [running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
Alan: The gentleman in the, uh, glasses.

Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.

Alan: Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions.

Dwight: Yeah.

Michael: [at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!

David: [confused] Oh, Michael?

Michael: Are we all set?

David: Isn't our interview tomorrow?

Michael: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.

David: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?

Michael: Thought I'd catch a show.

David: In the middle of a work day?

Michael: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.

David: Okay.

Michael: Um, how many people are you interviewing?

David: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.

Michael: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?

David: I don't think so.

Michael: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?

David: I believe we put you in charge.

Michael: Ah, great. No further questions.

David: Okay, Michael.

Michael: Okay.

David: I'm really looking forward to our interview.

Michael: And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Michael: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
Kevin: [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.

Jim: Hey, Kev.

Kevin: What's different about you? You look worse.

Jim: Thank you.

Meredith: You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.

Jim: Ohhh...

Meredith: Turn around.

Jim: No.

Meredith: Yes.

Jim: No way.

Meredith: Do it!

Andy: Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.

Jim: [exhales loudly] Andy...

Andy: What is it, Big Haircut?

Jim: Nothing.

Andy: Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.

Jim: Yup.

Andy: What?
Jim: Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Pam: Hey. I think it looks great.

Jim: Thanks, Pam.
Pam: After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.

Dwight: You wanted to see me?

Michael: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.

Dwight: But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry] Thank you.

Michael: Okay. Uh...

Dwight: [cries harder] Thank you, Michael.

Michael: Uh, okay.

Dwight: [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.

Michael: Stop crying.

Dwight: [sobbing] Thank you.

Michael: Ohhhhh...
Pam: Hey.

Karen: Hey.

Pam: Um, about the beach...

Karen: It's okay, we all say things without thinking.

Pam: Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.

Karen: [confused] Oh. Okay.
Karen: Pam is... kind of a b*tch.
Karen: Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.

Jim: Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Jim: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.

Michael: Why so you can do it?

Karen: [looks annoyed]

Jim: Whoops.

Michael: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...

Jim: Hmmm.

Karen: Heh.

Michael: Moon each other.

Jim: Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?

Michael: All right.

Jim: All right.

Michael: Your loss.

Karen: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?

Michael: Cruise control.

Karen: Oh.
Kevin: So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?

Jim: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.

Kevin: Pam is taller.

Jim: You sure?

Kevin: Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.

Jim: Wow.

Kevin: I think Karen has a prettier face.

Jim: Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?

Kevin: Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.

Jim: Hm. Really tough call.

Kevin: Yeah.

Jim: You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.

Kevin: Will do.

Jim: All right. [smiles]
Oscar: Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]

Pam: Wow, very funny.

Stanley: I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.

Kelly: Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.

Pam: [smiles]

Meredith: You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.

Creed: I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Creed: www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Ryan: Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Michael: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.

Kevin: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?

Michael: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.

Oscar: Maybe you should talk to her? Before...

Michael: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.

Oscar: Michael...

Kevin: What?

Angela: Why?

Oscar: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.

Michael: Yes, I...

Angela: Wha? Who gave you that advice?

Kevin: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...

Michael: I have to buy another place.

Angela: But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]

Oscar: You're not sure that you have the job.

Michael: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
Dwight: How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?

Angela: No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.

Dwight: No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.

Angela: [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Dwight: [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

Jim: Oh hey, Dwight.

Dwight: I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.

Jim: Does my room have cable?

Dwight: No. And the sheets are made of f*re.

Jim: Can I change rooms?

Dwight: Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.

Jim: Can I have a late checkout?

Dwight: I'll have to talk to the manager.

Jim: You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?

Dwight: I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!

Jim: Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?

Dwight: Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.

Jim: Go.

Dwight: Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Dwight: Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Andy: [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.

Dwight: Yes you will.
Michael: Who is D. Abramson?

Pam: He's from that company in Pitts...

Jan: [walks through front door] Michael.

Michael: Why... are you here?

Jan: Uh, how are you?

Michael: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.

Jan: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?

Michael: Why privately?

Jan: I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.

Michael: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.

Jan: Okay.

Michael: Okay.
Michael: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.

Pam: What do you want me to do?

Michael: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.

Pam: What about Meredith?

Michael: No. She's an alternate.
Michael: So, how you been?

Jan: Been good.

Michael: Good.

Jan: Good.

Michael: Yeah.

Jan: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.

Michael: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Pam: So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.

Karen: 'Cause of Jan again?

Karen: Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?

Pam: Uh, sure.

Karen: Thanks.

Pam: I really hope you get the job.

Karen: Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Jan: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.

Michael: Hmm.

Jan: To kinda clear my mind.

Michael: Sound good. Sounds fun.

Jan: It was. Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.

Michael: Hmm..

Jan: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.

Michael: Would you excuse me for a second?

Jan: Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Michael: Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.

Phyllis: What are you gonna do?

Michael: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...

Karen: Do you want to get back together with her?

Michael: No, no. What do I do?

Pam: Just don't get back together with her.

Michael: What if she makes me?

Angela: How can she make you get back together with her?

Michael: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.

Pam: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.

Michael: I wasn't.

Pam: You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.

Michael: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.

Pam: Right.

Michael: Wow.

Karen: Do it.

Michael: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Michael: [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
Michael: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Pam: Oh my God. [mouths to Jim] Huge!

Jim: Yeah, bigger actually.

Pam: [whispers] That's crazy!

Jim: Mm-hm.

Pam: [mouths] Wow!

Karen: [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God. Can you believe that?

Jim: Unbelievable.

Karen: Wow!

Jim: She could put the cup right there.

Karen: I know!
Pam: No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time.
Meredith: I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Kevin: I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.
Creed: I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots.
Jan: So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.

Michael: Yeah.

Jan: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.

Michael: First got priorities.

Jan: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...

Michael: Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
Michael: No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.
Dwight: Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps] Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name] Andrew Bernard.

Andy: Saving the best for first!

Karen: All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!

Dwight: No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.

Oscar: Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]

Dwight: What did I say!?

Pam: [to Jim] Good luck.

Jim: Thanks.
Pam: I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Dwight: I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?

Andy: White, because it contains all other colors.

Dwight: Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?

Andy: You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.

Dwight: What is the capital of Maine?

Andy: The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.

Dwight: Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.

Andy: Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.

Dwight: You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.

Andy: I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Andy: I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Dwight: [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.

Andy: Damn it!

Dwight: This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Karen: [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.

Jim: Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...

Karen: Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.

Jim: Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish?

Karen: No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.

Jim: Oh...

Karen: 'Cause I'm going to get the job.
Michael: [holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.

Jan: Thanks.

Michael: Wait, wait. Check one more time.

Jan: Oh, okay.

Michael: Very good [Jan nods]

Jan: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?

Michael: Yes, indeed.

Jan: Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Michael: So, I guess we're getting back together.

Pam: What happened?

Michael: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Michael: Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.
Karen: So we have all night. Where do you want to go first?

Jim: Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?

Karen: How often do you come here?

Jim: Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.

Karen: I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Michael: Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Dwight: [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Jim: [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.

Karen: That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Karen: So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?

Jim: Oh do you mean when I get the job?

Karen: Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there.

Jim: You mean Kevin?

Karen: Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there.

Jim: Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Michael: [exhales] How are you guys doing? Need anything?

Karen: Uh, no, we're good. Thanks.

Michael: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.

Jim: [points at bearded man] Who's that?

Michael: That is Beardy.

Jim: Beardy?

Michael: Mm-hmm.

Jim: I'm gonna introduce myself.

Michael: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...
Michael: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Dwight: Michael is gone.

Andy: Hail to the chief!

Dwight: My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.

Andy: My first order of business: accept.

Dwight: As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Andy: Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Michael: Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.

Hunter: Uh, administrative assistant.

Michael: Jan in yet?

Hunter: I think she's comin' in... later.

Michael: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?

Hunter: Sure.

Michael: Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means.

Hunter: Okay.

Michael: Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the "motorboat" noise] "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
Dwight: You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.

Pam: Thank you.

Dwight: I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.

Pam: Really?

Dwight: Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.

Pam: You will be your own assistant.

Dwight: Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.

Pam: Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager.

Dwight: Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.

Pam: Mm-hmm.

Dwight: Do you accept?

Pam: Absolutely, I do.
Pam: I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do."
Michael: [knocks on door] Hello, hello!

David: Michael, good to see you!

Michael: Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.

David: Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?

Michael: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.

David: Okay. And your strengths?

Michael: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.

David: Oh. Yes. Very good.

Michael: Thank you.

David: Very good.
Phyllis: Dwight is our new boss.

Oscar: Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.

Pam: Then who do you think will get the job?

Kevin: Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.

Phyllis: I think it's gonna be Michael.

Oscar: Do you really think he's qualified for that job?

Phyllis: No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.

Oscar: [laughs] Mm. Yeah.
Dwight: Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.

Pam: [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?

Dwight: Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.

Oscar: So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar?

Dwight: Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!

Stanley: Amen.

Dwight: Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.

Kevin: [raises hand] Do we have to?

Dwight: Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!
Pam: I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.
David: What do you think we could be doing better?

Michael: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that.

David: Okay!

Michael: Okay.

David: Thanks for comin' in, Michael.

Michael: Thank you.

David: It is always a treat when our paths cross.

Michael: It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.

David: You're back together.

Michael: Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.

David: Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.

Michael: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?

David: No, we're letting Jan go.
Dwight: Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from?

Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Trees.

Dwight: Trees! And where do trees grow?

Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Forest.

Dwight: Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head "no"] Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?

Stanley: Liquid.

Dwight: Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.

Stanley: I don't want it.

Dwight: Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!

Stanley: Make it 100.

Dwight: We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?

Stanley: No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.

Dwight: What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?

Stanley: The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.

Dwight: Okay---

Andy: That's it!

Dwight: What---

Andy: Class is canceled, everybody out!

Dwight: No wait, what are you doing?!

Andy: I'm punishing them.

Dwight: No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.

Everyone: [grumbling, getting loud]

Pam: HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]

Oscar: What--- What are you winking for?

Dwight: Zip your lid!
Karen: So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows?

David: Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...

Karen: Yeah?

David: ...what do you think about Michael Scott?

Karen: He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now.

David: This is off the record.

Karen: He would be disaster.
Jan: Hey you!

Michael: Hey.

Jan: How was your interview?

Michael: Pretty good.

Jan: Yeah?

Michael: Could have gone better I guess.

Jan: Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.

Michael: Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.

Jan: What?

Michael: Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.

Jan: What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there?

Michael: I can't tell you.

Jan: Tell me what?
Jan: You son of a b*tch!

David: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---

Jan: You're f*ring me? Where the hell do you get off?

David: Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.

Jan: Erratic?

David: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---

Jan: [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?

Michael: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---

Jan: No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!

David: It's not.

Jan: No?

David: It's not.

Jan: 'Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.

David: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.

Michael: Hey! You're unstable!

Jan: Yeah!

Michael: No--- We're all unstable.

Jan: Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving.

Michael: David, I did not tell her.
Andy: It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.

Dwight: It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]

Andy: This is gonna look so awesome!

Dwight: It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!

Andy: [laughs] Totally!
Jan: [giving a hug] Bye Hunter.

Hunter: Bye.

Jan: Good luck with your band.

Hunter: Oh, thank---

Jan: Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].

Michael: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.

David: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.

Michael: Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.

David: No, we're not giving you the job.

Michael: You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?

David: I do.

Michael: Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.

David: Yes.

Michael: Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Karen: Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.

Jim: Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.

Karen: Don't! She's nuts! [they laugh]

Jim: Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.

Karen: Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so...

Jim: Okay.

Karen: Just call me when you're done.

Jim: Sure.

Karen: Good luck, Halpert.

Jim: Thank you.

Receptionist: [phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure.
Jan: Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy!

Michael: I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible.

Jan: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]

Michael: Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.

Jan: [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?

Michael: [whispers] I don't know. [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.

Jan: Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work. This could work, really!
Michael: [in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!

Pam: How'd it go?

Michael: No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.
Michael: Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?

Dwight: To intimidate my subordinates.

Michael: That's stupid.

Dwight: It was Andy's idea.

Michael: You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. [laughs] Ryan, coffee.

Ryan: I don't do that stuff anymore.

Michael: No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
Michael: So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.

Pam: Did... Karen get the job?

Michael: [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
Dwight: Pam, hello.

Pam: Dwight, hello.

Dwight: I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
Pam: No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
David: I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.

Jim: I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]

David: Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy.

Jim: Thanks.

David: Always h*t your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---

Jim: I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?" [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]

David: Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?

Jim: Yes, absolutely.

David: And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out...

Jim: Oh, no, absolutely.

David: ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads "Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous! Pam" It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall. Ugh. So, first up...

Jim: [hands David his papers] There you go.

David: How do you think you function here in New York?

Jim: [not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight. [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.

David: You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?

Jim: [thinks] The friendships.

David: Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Jim: [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?

Pam: Medium rare. Thanks. [they laugh]

Jim: The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.

Pam: I know.

Jim: And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.

Pam: Well, I wish you would.
Pam: [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Pam: I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I sh*t him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]

Jim: Pam. [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?

Pam: Yes.

Jim: All right. Then... it's a date.

Pam: [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
David: [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. [laughs] Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.

Ryan: [on phone, smiling] I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.

Kelly: Who was that?

Ryan: [still smiling] Nobody. You and I are done.

Kelly: What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]

Dwight: [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?

Jim: [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.

Dwight: Hello? Hello?

Jim: Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...

Dwight: Jim, what are you doing?

Jim: And how many would you like?

Dwight: Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-

Jim: Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.

Dwight: [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Jim: Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
Dwight: [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.

Jim: [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight.

Pam: Hey, is this Dwight?

Jim: Yes it is.

Pam: Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.

Jim: Oh, thank you. I've been working out.

Dwight: Woah, woah, woah, Pam!

Pam: Have you?

Dwight: Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.

Pam: Dwight?

Dwight: No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!

Pam: I'm confused...

Dwight: Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.

Jim: Can't do that. Unsanitary.

Dwight: Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.

Jim: [office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight.
Jim: Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
Jim: Oh, hello Mater. Good news[/b]: I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman.

Dwight: [slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
Michael: Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
Toby: Morning.

Michael: Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]
Toby: Good morning, Kelly.

Kelly: I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?

Toby: Fine. Good.

Kelly: I feel weird.
Michael: First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.

Angela: We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.

Michael: Okay.

Angela: But so far we only have two pictures of him.

Michael: Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...

Pam: Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?

Michael: If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?

Angela: Michael...

Michael: Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-

Angela: No. You know-no!

Michael: Toga!

Angela: You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.

Michael: I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
Michael: Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
Michael: I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.

Pam: So how much antigravity potion do you want?

Angela: No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.

Michael: Phyllis, can you do this?

Phyllis: [whispers] Yes.
Pam: Hi, can I help you?

Holly: Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
Toby: As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
Toby: So this is H.R. This is your desk.

Holly: I love the view.

Toby: Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
Pam: Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]

Jim: Hey... What?

Pam: Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.

Jim: No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!

Pam: Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!

Jim: Yes! So when do you start?

Pam: I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.

Jim: Wow. Busy morning.

Pam: So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...

Jim: It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.

Pam: Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.

Jim: See how easy that is?

Pam: Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]
Pam: I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here!
Toby: Hey, Stanley...

Stanley: Hmm?

Toby: I want to introduce you to...

Michael: [watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.

Dwight: So what do we know about her?

Michael: Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.

Dwight: I hate her too.

Michael: Why do you hate her?

Dwight: Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.

Michael: You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.

Dwight: Would that be such a bad thing?

Michael: Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?

Dwight: What?

Michael: We need to sell her an elevator pass.

Dwight: But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]

Michael: Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
Phyllis: Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?

Woman over speakerphone: Antigravity machines?

Phyllis: That's right. Yeah.

Woman over speakerphone: What do they do exactly?

Phyllis: They make you feel lighter...

Woman over speakerphone: Antigravity... Um... Anti...depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.

Phyllis: Okay.
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.

Toby: Hey Michael.

Michael: Oh, hey, do you still work here?

Toby: I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.

Michael: Nah.

Toby: Come on.

Michael: No. I think I will pass.

Toby: Michael Scott, this is Holly.

Holly: Hi.

Michael: Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here[/b]: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert[/b]: I'm gonna win.

Holly: Man, someone doesn't like H.R.

Michael: Yeah.

Holly: [to Toby] What did you do to him?

Toby: Nothing.

Michael: T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.

Holly: Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.

Michael: Y-You can-Michael.
Michael: Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
Creed: [shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.

Holly: Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.

Creed: Any time.

Holly: What do you do here?

Creed: ...Excuse me.
Creed: What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
Dwight: [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?

Holly: No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]

Dwight: He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.

Holly: Oh. Good for you guys.

Dwight: Yeah.
Dwight: Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Dwight: Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]

Holly: Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi.

Kevin: Hi.

Holly: What do you do?

Kevin: I do the numbers.

Holly: Oh, good for you.

Kevin: Do you want a M&M?

Holly: Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.

Kevin: Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.

Holly: Well that is a very safe place for them.

Kevin: Yeah.

Michael: Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?

Holly: Oh... [laughs along] Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.

Michael: I bet.

Holly: That's good.

Michael: I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?

Holly: No, no, I...

Michael: Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?

Holly: Ooh, uh...

Michael: You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?

Holly: Um... Y-yeah. Okay.

Michael: All right.

Holly: Thanks.

Michael: Yep.

Holly: Great.
Pam: Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.

Toby: You're-you're not in it.

Pam: Well I was taking the picture.

Toby: I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.

Pam: Sure, do you have a camera here?

Toby: No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh...

Pam: Okay...

Toby: I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office]
Jim: [on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.

Ryan: Congratulations!

Jim: Thanks.

Ryan: Don't interrupt.

Jim: I just-

Ryan: Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?

Jim: No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...

Ryan: All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.

Jim: All right, well it already went through, so...

Ryan: Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]

Jim: Hello?
Michael: [listening to "Crash Into Me" on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...

Jim: That's not it.

Michael: Music...

Jim: Yeah.

Michael: For a CD mix tape...

Jim: Close.

Michael: For Holly.

Jim: Mmhmm.

Michael: And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.

Jim: What are the two levels?

Michael: The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...

Jim: Mmhmm.

Michael: And "I... love you."

Jim: Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level.

Michael: Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?

Jim: Yes. You don't love Holly.

Michael: I think I do.

Jim: But you just met her.

Michael: Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.

Jim: Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.

Michael: Well, you're not a romantic.

Jim: Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.

Michael: Oh really?

Jim: Yeah.

Michael: Like, with who?

Jim: We've been through this.

Michael: Pam?

Jim: Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.

Michael: Yeah, you took it too slow.

Jim: Well, we're really happy.

Michael: This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.

Jim: And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.

Michael: I don't want her to get away.

Jim: I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
Jim: I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?

Phyllis: Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...

Jim: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.

Phyllis: Why would you do that?

Jim: Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]

Phyllis: Really?

Jim: Well we all want a good party, right?
Jim: I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
Holly: Hey Kevin.

Kevin: Hi.

Holly: Do you need some help?

Kevin: I can't decide what to get.

Holly: Well, what do you like to eat?

Kevin: Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.

Holly: Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.

Kevin: Hmm...
Kevin: I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Jim: [on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]
Holly: [tool clicking] Damn it!

Michael: Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.

Holly: Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.

Michael: And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.

Holly: Yoga.

Michael: [as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...

Holly: [as Yoda] Pass curvy metal piece, you will.

Michael: So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.

Holly: Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!

Michael: Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!

Holly: [overdramatically] Acting!

Michael: [overdramatically] Acting!

Holly: [laughs] Lovitz.

Michael: Yeah.
Michael: I did it! [exhales]

Jim: What'd you do?

Michael: I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.

Jim: Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?

Michael: It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.

Jim: Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.

Michael: Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...

Jim: There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!

Michael: [giddy] Yeah...
Phyllis: Hello Angela.

Angela: Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart att*ck.

Phyllis: Can I get a list of your vendors?

Angela: I shredded it.

Phyllis: Why would you do that?

Angela: Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?

Phyllis: [knocks files off desk] Sorry.
Toby: [Michael and Holly are still working on the chair] What'd you guys do?

Michael: Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?

Toby: Well, we still have to do the exit interview.

Michael: Yes we do.
Michael: I'll let you in on a little secret[/b]: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
Toby: [Michael hands him a present] Wow, thanks, Michael, I...

Michael: Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.

Holly: [enters conference room] Hello.

Michael: Hey! Hi, good to see you.

Holly: You too.

Michael: I'm just having a little exit interview.

Holly: Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.

Michael: Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?

Holly: No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.

Michael: Okay.

Pam: [enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?

Toby: Hi Pam. Stay.

Pam: Okay.

Michael: Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?

Toby: I'm Toby.

Michael: Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?

Holly: Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?

Michael: Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.

Holly: Here you go.

Michael: Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?

Toby: This place, um...

Michael: Well, no no no no no...

Toby: I've got some ideas, I guess...

Michael: No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.

Holly: Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.

Toby: Well let me see... I would, uh...

Michael: [hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll k*ll you.

Toby: I guess everything's okay.
Toby: I made it this far, right? What's the point?
Pam: Toby, why don't you open your present?

Michael: Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...

Toby: [unwraps present; present is a rock with a Post-It note rubber-banded to it; reads] "Suck on this."

Michael: What the hell is that?

Pam: Michael...

Michael: That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!

Dwight: You did.

Michael: No!

Dwight: You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]

Michael: Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.

Pam: So what is your gift?

Michael: My gift is forthcoming, Pam.

Pam: What is it?

Michael: I am going to give Toby...

Pam: Your watch?

Michael: ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?

Pam: I just knew.

Michael: How did you know?

Holly: Oh that is so sweet.

Michael: Well... That's my watch.

Toby: Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.

Michael: Hey, that's good.

Creed: [from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]

Dwight: Oh my gosh.

Creed: It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]

Pam: Is that the police?

Dwight: Yes.

Creed: Mm-hmm.
Oscar: Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice[/b]: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as "misleading the shareholders." Another good term is "fraud." The real crime, I think, was the beard.
Michael: [still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
Kelly: I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison."
Jim: Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?

Pam: Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver]

Jim: [clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]
Holly: What's protocol on this?

Toby: I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door]

Holly: Michael, are you okay?

Michael: [voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.

Holly: Oh, of course you are.

Michael: Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.

Holly: No, hey.

Michael: I'm cool.

Holly: Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
Michael: Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
Kevin: [everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!

Phyllis: Kevin, take your shoes off first!

Michael: No antigravity machine, huh?

Phyllis: Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.

Michael: Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
Pam: Wow. Look at our parking lot.

Jim: Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles]
Pam: Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
Holly: Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.

Michael: That's what she... a lot of places are like that.

Holly: I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.

Michael: Thanks.
Dwight: You have it?

Meredith: Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]

Dwight: Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]

Michael: I like, uh...

Holly: That-That's my car.

Michael: Hey. What are you doing?

Dwight: [Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!

Michael: What the hell is going on here?!

Dwight: N-nothing you need to know the details of.

Michael: There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!

Dwight: N-no there's not.

Michael: Why did you do that?

Dwight: It was playful hazing.

Michael: No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World w*r II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?

Dwight: It's not rabid.

Michael: Shh...

Meredith: Thanks for bringing that up.

Dwight: Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
Michael: I'm really sorry.

Holly: Michael, thank you so much for saying that. [puts a hand on his arm] I feel so welcome here.

Michael: Yeah...

Holly: I just... Um, excuse me.
Michael: Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]
Vance Refrigeration guy: Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!

Phyllis: Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Holly: Cool! You drive your own car?

Kevin: Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?

Holly: Yep. Just like you.

Kevin: Okay, bye.

Holly: Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
Michael: [on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?

Pam: [everyone applauds] Yay, Phyllis!

Michael: Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.

Pam: Song parody writer.

Michael: I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."

Jim: Classic.

Michael: Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."

Jim: Not my favorite, but...

Pam: I like that one.

Jim: It's not my favorite...

Pam: I like that one.

Michael: I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?

Darryl: Yeah. [music starts]

Michael: [sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
Pam: I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
Michael: [singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
Pam: Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
Michael: [singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
Holly: Not bad.

Michael: Oh, hey. Thanks.

Holly: Someday I would love to hear "Beers in Heaven."

Michael: Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.

Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.

Michael: Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.

Kevin: No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.

Michael: What is it?

Kevin: Just hurry. [hangs up]

Holly: Is he okay?

Michael: Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.

Holly: Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.

Michael: Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
Jan: Well it was good to see you.

Kevin: It was great to see you, Jan.

Jan: Yeah, so...

Michael: O-kay. Hello Jan.

Jan: Hello... Michael.

Michael: Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?

Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I just uh...

Jan: I...

Kevin: I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.

Michael: Oh, okay.

Kevin: Yeah.

Michael: Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
Michael: Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?

Jan: No.

Michael: Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?

Jan: Uh, no.

Michael: Good. Good. Thank God.

Jan: I didn't...

Michael: Cause that's...

Jan: ... touch that.

Michael: Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...

Jan: Why?

Michael: Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...

Jan: Yeah, it did...

Michael: ... proud.

Jan: ... happen when...

Michael: Um...

Jan: ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.

Michael: You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?

Jan: ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.

Michael: Well, okay...

Jan: Yeah.

Michael: So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...

Jan: I went to a sperm bank.

Michael: You did?

Jan: Yuh-huh.

Michael: When we were going out?

Jan: Uh, yeah.

Michael: W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.

Jan: I know.

Michael: You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?

Jan: No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.

Michael: IHop.

Jan: IHop.
Jan: If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a sh*t at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
Jan: Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.

Michael: I'm glad you told me.

Jan: Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...

Michael: Um, I'll... I have to think about it.

Jan: Okay.
Michael: My whole life, I have known two things[/b]: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
Pam: Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music]
Angela: [to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
Jim: [gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey...

Andy: [on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard]

Darryl: Unh! Damn it!

Andy: Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring]

Angela: ...Okay.

Andy: Into the mic, sweetie.

Angela: I said, okay.

Andy: She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply]
Andy: I've been carrying that ring around in my wallet for six years. Because you don't know when you're gonna meet the right girl and the moment's gonna be right. And tonight, with the fireworks, and the music, and everything... it was right.
Kelly: Can I be your bridesmaid?

Angela: No.
Dwight: Well... it's my own fault.
Andy: Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small expl*si*n sound] I'm engaged!

Jim: I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.

Andy: Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it.
Toby: Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us.

Pam: Oh, yeah, um...

Toby: Yeah, could we...

Pam: Sure. Meredith, do you mind?

Toby: [hands Meredith his camera] This one right here.

Meredith: Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.

Toby: It's digital, so just take as many as you want.

Meredith: One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Pam: I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight...
Holly: Hey there.

Michael: Hey.

Holly: So you missed something really big.

Michael: Yeah?

Holly: Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.

Michael: Oh, wow.

Holy: I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but...

Michael: Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...

Holly: So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...

Michael: Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.

Holly: Okay.

Kevin: I'll go to the diner with you.

Holly: Oh that would be great.

Kevin: Yeah, we can go eat pie.

Holly: I love pie.

Kevin: Me too.

Holly: Okay.

Michael: Have a good night.

Holly: Okay. Good night.

Michael: Bye.
Holly: Yeah, it was a good day. I mean, first days are always the hardest, right? Well, I should go. [Kevin is waiting in the car] I gotta buckle him in.
Michael: Well this is it. I am here to see you off.

Toby: Thanks... [Hank is standing next to Michael] Really, Michael?

Michael: Sorry. Corporate policy.

Toby: It's not.

Michael: You might take something.

Hank: I don't think he's gonna take anything.

Michael: Okay, security guard.
Toby: [watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.

Michael: Okay.
Michael: [on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
Phyllis: Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]

Angela: [sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God!

Dwight: What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
